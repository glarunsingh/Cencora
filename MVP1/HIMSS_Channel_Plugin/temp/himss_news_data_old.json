        "news_date": "2024-06-25:00",
        "news_content": "The Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust has become the first institution in the UK and Europe to receive Stage 6 validation on the HIMSS Adoption Model for Analytics Maturity or \u201cAMAM.\u201d John Rayner, Senior Director of Analytics at HIMSS, praised CHFT's efforts in achieving AMAM Stage 6, particularly highlighting the self-service access to data provided to clinicians through a comprehensive knowledge portal. \"Clinicians have access to the data through a knowledge portal, from which they also receive an accompanying narrative that explains what the data\u2014often numbers, charts, and graphs\u2014is telling them,\" Rayner noted. This feature ensures that healthcare professionals can easily interpret and utilize the data, enhancing their ability to make informed decisions and improve patient outcomes. \u201cIt\u2019s the culmination of a 10-year journey to embed technology and data science within our culture. This is deserved recognition for the hard work and team approach across CHFT and our colleagues at The Health Informatics Service,\u201d said Rob Birkett, CHFT\u2019s Chief Digital and Information Officer. \u201cThe reason why HIMSS is so well thought of is that its validations are approached from a patient-centered perspective. We knew it was the right thing to do and we\u2019ve absolutely stuck with it. We should be very proud of what we've achieved as a Trust - it's not just what we've done, but it's how we've done it\" Julian Bates, CHFT\u2019s Information Director, was both delighted and extremely proud of the accreditation: \u201cThis was a really great result and great team effort supported by many CHFT colleagues. We must thank HIMSS for their support throughout [...] the process. That said, it is important to acknowledge Business Intelligence and Data Science could not have moved forwards the past 3 to 4 years without the support and strength within THIS from Technical, Governance and Coding teams. This accreditation is a well done to all\u201d As part of their commitment to digital health modernization, CHFT is also participating in the beta testing phase for the new AMAM modernization program, with the ambitious goal of reaching Stage 7 by the end of the year. CHFT also aims to achieve Stage 6 in EMRAM and INFRAM, showing their dedication to advancing their digital capabilities. The HIMSS AMAM maturity model measures the analytics capabilities that healthcare organizations have gained from having a strong analytics strategy and competency and advances an organization\u2019s healthcare analytics regardless of the technologies installed.

        "news_title": "HHS Releases Final Rule Establishing Provider Disincentives for Information Blocking",
        "news_date": "2024-06-24:00",
        "news_content": "On June 24, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a final rule establishing financial disincentives for healthcare providers found to have committed information blocking. In a corresponding press statement , HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra stated, \u201cthis final rule is designed to ensure we always have access to our own health information and that our care teams have the benefit of this information to guide their decisions. With this action, HHS is taking a critical step toward a health care system where people and their health providers have access to their electronic health information. \u201cWhen health information can be appropriately accessed and exchanged, care is more coordinated and efficient, allowing the health care system to better serve patients. But we must always take the necessary actions to ensure patient privacy and preferences are protected \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what this rule does.\u201d Information blocking by healthcare providers will be investigated by the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG). Providers found to be information blocking will be subject to the following disincentives: Under the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program, an eligible hospital (EH) or critical access hospital (CAH) that is found by OIG to have committed information blocking will not be a meaningful electronic health record (EHR) user during the calendar year of the EHR reporting period. This makes the EH\u00a0not able to earn three quarters of the annual market basket increase they would have been able to earn for successful program participation; for CAHs, payment will be reduced to 100 percent of reasonable costs instead of 101 percent. This disincentive will start within 30 days of the final rule\u2019s publication. Under the Promoting Interoperability performance category of the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS), a MIPS eligible clinician (including a group practices) found to be information blocking by OIG will not be a meaningful EHR user during the calendar year of the MIPS performance period. This ensures the EC will receive a score of zero for the MIPS Promoting Interoperability category, which is one quarter of the EC or group\u2019s final MIPS score in a performance year. If an individual EC who is part of a larger group is found to be information blocking, the disincentive would only apply to the individual, not the entire group. This disincentive will be effective 30 days after publication of the final rule. HIMSS supported this change in public comments provided to HHS in January 2024 , suggesting that OIG had the ability to discern if an individual was participating in information blocking within the group but it wasn\u2019t consistent with the rest of the group\u2019s information sharing compliance and if so, the entire group shouldn\u2019t be subject to a penalty. Under the Medicare Shared Savings Program, a healthcare provider that is an Accountable Care Organization (ACO), ACO participant or ACO provider or supplier who has committed information blocking may be ineligible to participate in the program for a period of at least one year and may not receipt revenue they would have otherwise earned through the MSSP. CMS also finalized that it would consider the relevant facts and circumstances, like the time since the information blocking conduct and the healthcare provider\u2019s diligence correcting the problem, before applying a disincentive under the Shared Savings Program. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and CMS will host a joint information session about the final rule on June 26, 2024, at 2 p.m. ET. More information on the session can be found at healthit.gov/informationblocking .

        "news_date": "2024-06-14:00",
        "news_content": "HIMSS has delivered recommendations to the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) for how diverse and underserved communities can be more preemptively engaged in the design, development and validation of health IT tools and systems. The Health Equity by Design Concept Paper details how ONC will use certification and other policy levers to ensure health equity is built into interoperable health information and technology systems. In a feedback letter to ONC , HIMSS offered recommendations to guide the office\u2019s approach for addressing practical health IT coordination challenges facing underserved communities. Involvement of stakeholders from underserved patient populations from the beginning of the design, development and monitoring of health information and technology tools is critical for ensuring health equity. To facilitate engagement of these communities, HIMSS recommended ONC consider utilizing design thinking in the context of a learning health system framework to maximize equity focused innovation. User-centric design should be developed with a wide-range of health literacy and other capabilities of all patient populations. Scalable frameworks that consider the challenges faced by healthcare delivery sites focused on caring for underserved communities should be considered when health IT standards and systems are under development. HIMSS recommended that ONC include equity by design mechanisms through its federal coordination efforts, technical guidance and certification criteria specifications for equity metrics. To build trust in underserved communities, HIMSS called on ONC to improve and be more intentional when engaging in community collaboration with underserved communities, especially Tribal populations, when considering the design and implementation of health IT systems in a manner to promote health equity. HIMSS is invested in working with stakeholders across the sector to co-design actionable frameworks for industry and providers to incorporate health equity by design.

        "news_date": "2024-06-11:00",
        "news_content": "HIMSS has reiterated its call for significant investment in public health information data modernization and interoperability capability. HIMSS submitted its call to action through public comments responding to a request for information (RFI) from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services about methods to improve electronic reporting of public health data to state and local public health agencies. The RFI, which was part of CMS\u2019s annual Inpatient Prospective Payment System proposed rule , asked stakeholders about potential methods, including changing the attestation measure for capability to report public health data electronically to a numerator/denominator quality measure. HIMSS indicated measuring success in reporting public health data is a goal, but the current lack of capability in many public health agencies to receive the data electronically would require a wide range of exemptions, limiting the value of a measure while placing additional burden on health systems. HIMSS continues to endorse significant IT infrastructure funding, with corresponding technical support and workforce development by HHS, as recommended in HIMSS 2022 Public Health Information and Technology Infrastructure Funding Report . In the response, HIMSS also supported proposed changes by CMS for electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM) reporting for both the Promoting Interoperability Program and the Inpatient Quality Reporting Program. The proposed changes included the addition of patient safety focused measures (measuring patient falls and post-surgical respiratory failure) to the self-selected menu for quality reporting starting in 2026, and increasing the number of eCQMs required for reporting, going from six to nine in 2026 and nine to eleven in 2027. HIMSS\u2019s assessment of the new measures determined that the timeline to successfully implement the mechanisms for capturing and reporting the needed data to meet the measures was appropriate, and each of the new measures are meaningful and actionable, meaning improving measure performance should positively impact patient outcomes.

        "news_date": "2024-06-11:00",
        "news_content": "The HIMSS Arizona Chapter recently hosted a cohort of students studying healthcare at Bryan University on a trip to Washington, D.C., for an inside look at policy and advocacy. The students visited the HIMSS office in Virginia to learn about some of the current public policy priorities being led by the HIMSS Government Relations team. Arizona Chapter Advocate Marjorie Rosen organized the trip as part of the HIMSS Chapter Advocacy Program, which leverages HIMSS\u2019s reach and resources to influence public policy to advance healthcare and population health for all. Marci Little, a health administration student at Bryan University, class of 2025, wrote the following summary of her experience. The healthcare students from Bryan University were given the opportunity to be in Washington, D.C., for a week from April 12-18. We were invited to participate in the school\u2019s Paralegal Program trip. We got the chance to see memorials, monuments, The Supreme Court, Capitol Hill and so many other sites. For me, I was so glad to be able to see the monuments and memorials, but what I wasn\u2019t prepared for was the amazing experience of advocating through HIMSS. This was the best most memorable part of the week for me! For three nights of the trip, we were given the basics of what advocacy is, how it works and what to expect by Marjorie Rosen, Program Director of Healthcare. Everyone had the opportunity to ask questions regarding advocacy and how it works. I knew about advocacy as I had to do a PPE in advocacy to get my associate\u2019s degree. I started to see myself advocating after that assignment. My love of advocacy was fueled during this trip! We attended a meeting with HIMSS in D.C. They showed us everything they possibly could about advocacy. It was beyond amazing! I fell in love with advocacy. We met some amazing people and even got to take a few photos with them. Questions were asked and answered while each of us took notes, mentally or written. We had the chance to see Marjorie teach alongside the HIMSS group regarding what the MATCH IT Act is and how we could help. For our advocacy day on Capitol Hill, we were split into groups. Our job was to meet with our representatives and get them on board with the MATCH IT Act. I had the pleasure of being the speaker of our group at each of our meetings. I am not a great speaker, but I found my voice in advocating. If I took anything from this trip, it is that advocacy is needed to change things, whether it\u2019s in healthcare, government or in your own life. I am so grateful for the opportunity we had to be a part of this during that week. If given the opportunity again, I would gladly take it!

        "news_content": "President Biden\u2019s Fiscal Year 2025 (FY2025) proposed budget for the U.S. Health and Hyman Services (HHS) included $86 million for the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), an increase of $17 million above the FY2024 enacted level. As Congress begins to draft their annual spending bills, HIMSS led a multi-stakeholder initiative urging the leaders of the Labor, HHS, and Related Agencies (Labor-HHS) Appropriations subcommittees to fully fund ONC at the president\u2019s proposed FY25 budget request. This increase in funding would help advance interoperability and nationwide, standards-based health information exchange to support better health enabled by data. Read the full letter to congressional appropriations . HIMSS, along with AHIMA and CHIME, led the joint effort that garnered over 50 signers. The letter explained that this necessary funding boost would provide the agency with the resources they have long needed to better serve as the key partner to both public and private sector stakeholders to advance the health information and technology ecosystem. Without this much-needed increase, the organizations worry that they will be hard-pressed to successfully execute the many agency initiatives, and priorities of Congress and the Administration. ONC supports a wide array of initiatives aimed at advancing national goals for better, safer, and more equitable healthcare through a nationwide interoperable health IT infrastructure. These include ensuring technology solutions incorporate baseline cybersecurity and privacy requirements, a health equity by design philosophy for federal health IT programs, continued advancements in patient access to health information and meaningful engagement in their care, and working to advance U.S. public health data infrastructure modernization.
