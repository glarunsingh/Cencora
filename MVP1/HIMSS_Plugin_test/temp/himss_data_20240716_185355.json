        "news_content": "WASHINGTON,\u00a0July 15, 2024\u00a0/PRNewswire/ -- Guidehouse , a leading global provider of strategy and managed services to commercial and public sector clients, today\u00a0announced a partnership with the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) to deploy HIMSS' Digital Health Indicator (DHI) to assess the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services' (DHSS') progress toward digital health transformation. The public health data landscape survey and strategic transformation maturity assessment\u00a0will leverage HIMSS' DHI to measure the current state of Missouri DHSS' public health information across the agency and its bureaus, divisions, and local public health authorities. Assessment results will guide improvements in how data are collected, managed, and utilized to create efficiencies and improve the health of Missourians. This is the first time the HIMSS DHI will be used to assess a US state public health department. \"Enhancing the health of\u00a0Missouri\u00a0communities requires a clear understanding of our current digital health maturity landscape,\" said Dr.\u00a0Josh Wymer, chief health information and data strategy officer at the Missouri DHSS. \"We look forward to working with Guidehouse and HIMSS to identify strengths and opportunities to inform a comprehensive digital health strategy designed to increase system capacity and improve population health.\" In addition to deploying HIMSS' DHI tool, Guidehouse will engage with DHSS leadership and stakeholders statewide to ensure appropriate entities and individuals provide input into the assessment. HIMSS will conduct an analysis of strengths and opportunities to advance digital capacity. \"It's well established that public health data and information systems nationwide require attention in order to improve data availability and systems interoperability and increase surge capacity,\" said\u00a0Tamyra Porter, Guidehouse partner and State Health leader. \"We're excited to work with Missouri DHSS and HIMSS on this innovative and ambitious evaluation. This is groundbreaking work that will help inform discussions about a standardized framework for assessing data maturity across state and local public health agencies.\" Through this initiative, HIMSS will deliver globally standardized digital health scores across the four dimensions of digital health \u2013 governance and workforce, interoperability, predictive analytics, and person-enabled health \u2013 and prepare a transformation framework of systems and workflows. The DHI tool will also provide information necessary to inform evidence-based decision-making and recommendations for improvements as a critical component of a report to be delivered to DHSS upon completion of the project in early 2025. \"This first-of-its-kind project with Guidehouse and the Missouri Public Health team is well-positioned to establish\u00a0Missouri's\u00a0leadership in digital transformation across state public health systems,\" said Dr.\u00a0Anne Snowdon, chief scientific research officer at HIMSS.\u00a0\"The HIMSS team is honored to work with these leaders to advance digital maturity in public health agencies that has the potential to achieve an agile, data-driven, and high performing public health system to support and strengthen the health of every\u00a0Missouri\u00a0citizen.\" More than 67,000 institutions across 13 countries work with HIMSS' DHI to create tailored, comprehensive strategies to meet specific health system needs and address priorities. Approximately 43 US healthcare organizations have used the DHI for global benchmarking system-wide, jurisdiction-wide, and with individual hospitals.

        "news_content": "Dr. Jebran is in his second year on the HIMSS Physician Committee, and in those two years he has contributed to care at home and care transformation discussions along with the future of AI and contributing to the HIMSS Large Language Model series published in 2023. Dr. Jebran is always thinking a step ahead to help ensure the industry is benefiting from the content produced by the HIMSS Physician Committee's content. We would like to thank Dr. Jebran for all that he has contributed to in the industry. Below are some of his thoughts on careers in HIT and what he sees as the future of HIT. How have industry connections and relationships helped you achieve your biggest professional milestones? Dr Jebran : Being an active member of the HIMSS Physicians Committee and a LinkedIn Top Voice has been instrumental in achieving professional milestones by fostering collaborative opportunities, knowledge sharing, leadership networking, and providing platforms for career growth. What are the benefits of a health information and technology career? Why should someone consider it? Dr. Jebran : As healthcare increasingly adopts advanced technologies, a career in Health IT and informatics will position physicians at the forefront of these transformative changes. Physicians can positively impact a wider circle of patients' lives, enhance patient care delivery through data-driven decisions, streamline healthcare processes and workflows, and improve overall system efficiency. What do you see as the future of health information and technology? Where do you think the industry can/will go? Dr. Jebran : Healthcare will continue transforming from volume to value-based care delivery, where AI and ML are leveraged to predict outcomes, admissions, and costs and approach care delivery proactively rather than reactively. Healthcare delivery will emphasize the role of remote patient monitoring, and there will be a seismic shift of care to patients' homes rather than mainly hospital-based care. Join Us as We Reimagine Health Through Information and Technology At HIMSS, our vision is to realize the full health potential of every human, everywhere. Be part of the community that\u2019s transforming the global health ecosystem with courage, curiosity, and determination. Be part of what\u2019s next for health",
