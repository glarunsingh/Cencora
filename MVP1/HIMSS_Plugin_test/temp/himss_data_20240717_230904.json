        "news_content": "The National Indian Health Board (NIHB) has identified three key policy areas for advancing health equity for American Indians and Alaska Natives with the help of data. The NIHB hosted its first-ever\u202fTribal Health Equity Data Symposium over two days in September at American University in Washington, D.C. During the symposium, the NIHB addressed (1) measuring health equity considering tribal sovereignty, strengths and Indigenous identities (2) promising practices for improving how to collect data about race and ethnicity and (3) challenges and opportunities in tribal access to data held by federal and state agencies. HIMSS is an avid partner in NIHB\u2019s efforts to further enhance tribal community engagement opportunities. Presentations from recognized data stewards illuminated the long-unmet representation in tribal data collection, showing how data could efficiently flow accurately and bidirectionally within tribal populations. Speakers also emphasized that data collection and analysis practices must honor both tribal sovereignty and Indigenous knowledge. During the symposium, attendees discussed the importance of establishing appropriate privacy and consent protections to advance tribal health data sharing. Each tribe is unique, with a wide variety of cultural differences and sensitivities that set each tribe\u2019s data collection needs apart from the other 574 federally recognized tribes. Stakeholders recommended that federal regulators conduct tribal consultations with each tribe to create an agreed-upon data exchange governance to establish data access for individual tribal nations. The goal of tribal consultations is to have an individualized approach for each sovereign tribe that ensures the data collection is being properly respected, collected and accounted for. This ensures tribes have timely and precise data to improve their community health and wellness while having direct input in the way their tribal data is collected.

        "news_content": "Washington State Department of Health, as one of the leading innovators in digital applications for improving public health, has been recognized as a 2023 HIMSS Public Health Davies Award recipient. Washington State Department of Health, in partnership with the University of Washington, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Microsoft Research, the Brotman Baty Institute, Amazon Web Services, MITRE, the Association of Public Health Laboratories, the Internet Security Research Group, the National Institutes of Health, and the Linux Foundation, implemented \u201cWA Notify,\u201d a novel, privacy-preserving, exposure notification tool created to complement traditional contract tracing processes. From the launch of WA Notify to the case study submission to HIMSS for Davies consideration, more than 225,000 people who tested positive for COVID-19 used WA Notify to anonymously notify contacts of potential exposure. The model of collaboration to develop, implement, and promote utilization of the WA Notify tool is an important roadmap for the deployment of digital health tools in public health settings in the future. \u201cWA Notify was developed by the Washington State Department of Health and partners from the private, public, and academic sectors at the height of the COVID emergency,\u201d said Washington State Secretary of Health, Dr. Umair Shah. \u201cIt revolutionized the way people can receive notification of exposure, so they know when to get tested and protect their communities. At DOH we are so proud of this work and how it has so quickly benefited not only Washington state, but also many other states across the nation; we are thrilled to see its future, as well, as we face other public health emergencies.

Explore what drives these leaders, learn about their organizations and consider championing their missions. Learn more about Global Health Equity Week . Marina El Khawand, Medonations Marina El Khawand founded Medonations NGO at the age of 18 after the 2020 Beirut explosion, marking the genesis of her journey as a passionate humanitarian and human rights advocate. Her early involvement in humanitarian and community work, rooted in her upbringing within the Lebanese community, formed a strong foundation. Marina's engagement continued through her school years, culminating in her association with Girl Scouts. These experiences collectively shaped the woman, humanitarian and lawyer she is today, driving transformative global change and fiercely advocating for equal health rights for all. Tell us about your organization\u2019s mission, its impact on advancing healthier communities and the people you serve. Medonations' mission unfolds as a lifeline for Lebanon's communities. Born from the aftermath of the devastating 2020 Beirut explosion, our organization's core purpose is to provide free, equal, and equitable medical assistance to all individuals across the nation. What began as a response to the immediate crisis has grown into a lasting commitment to advancing healthier communities. After three years of tireless fieldwork day and night, Medonations stands as a beacon of hope and impact. Through our relentless efforts, we have saved over 20,000 lives across the country. Our reach extends globally as we have established connections with both Lebanese and non-Lebanese individuals from over 50 countries. These connections have led to the establishment of medical collection points in these countries, all united in the name of humanity and the shared purpose of saving lives. Medonations' impact is felt profoundly within Lebanon's borders as well. We have covered the costs of more than 110 surgeries for Lebanese individuals, providing vital medical interventions that would have otherwise been out of reach. This holistic approach to healthcare encompasses their commitment to providing medications, medical checkups, surgical support, and even essential supplies like baby formula and diapers. We serve the hopeful eyes of the elderly woman who finally receives the medication she needs, the anxious child who finds solace in our embrace, and the struggling family whose burdens are eased. Each life we touch through Medonations embodies a story of resilience, a testament to the human spirit's capacity to thrive amidst adversity. What is your long-term goal? And what will it take to reach this goal? Our long-term goal, aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, is to ensure equitable access to healthcare for all by 2030. To achieve this, we aim to expand our reach by establishing comprehensive community free clinics (fixed and mobile) across Lebanon, offering free medical services, medications, educational programs, and preventive care. Partnering with more individuals across the recent and new countries to collect more medications and launch new drives in new nations and cities. We will continue to advocate for policy changes that prioritize healthcare as a fundamental right. Continuous fundraising efforts and engaging a global network of supporters will be pivotal in sustaining our mission and amplifying our impact. Are you looking for certain types of technology partnerships who can support your mission? Absolutely, Medonations is actively seeking technology partnerships that align with our mission to expand access to quality healthcare. We're particularly interested in collaborations that can provide advanced medical equipment such as wearable skin patches with Advanced AED machines (portable), AccuVein AV500, patient detection watches, new rapid tests or test patched to detect deseases (other than covid, HIV \u2026) embedded biosensors, wearable devices, wearable exoskeletons, smart contact lenses, and smart glasses. These technologies should be user-friendly, space-efficient, and equipped with accurate capabilities to enhance patient care, diagnosis, and treatment. Our goal is to equip our upcoming free clinics with state-of-the-art equipment that facilitates early detection, treatment, and healing processes. We welcome partnerships with technology providers who share our vision of accessible healthcare for all . What are ways HIMSS members and staff can get involved with your organization? HIMSS members can engage with our organization in impactful ways to become lifesavers: Promote Medonations' mission through their network and raise awareness about our efforts to expand equitable healthcare access.

The call to action, included in a HIMSS response to a request for comment from the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) minority leader Senator Bill Cassidy , indicates that the United States \u201cneeds a robust, comprehensive privacy law that is universally implementable, applicable to all entities that access protected health information regardless of site or platform and offers the flexibility that may be required to deliver appropriate care to an individual.\u201d The HIMSS letter notes that the rapidly changing health ecosystem, which includes websites, applications and other direct-to-consumer health technologies, has created new risks to protected health information. The call to action indicates that any actor who has the capability of accessing protected health information should have the same level of privacy protection and breach notification responsibilities as HIPAA-covered entities. HIMSS indicated that these protections and responsibilities are critical to establishing seamless, secure, ubiquitous and nationwide data access and interoperable health information exchange to transform the health ecosystem and promote health innovation at the institutional and personal level. In addition to a call to action on privacy, HIMSS offered recommendations in response to Exploring Congress\u2019 Framework for the Future of AI , a whitepaper published by the Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions about the oversight and legislative role of Congress over the integration of artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector. HIMSS emphasized that \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d can\u2019t be an overarching catch-all terminology for legislative and regulatory oversight, noting differences in the types and functions of AI and machine learning applications and differences in the types of data used to feed the models. In the AI whitepaper response, HIMSS called on Congress to encourage the healthcare community to adopt consensus-based based practices, standards and guidelines for the types of resource information and best practices for revalidation of the models, training and technical support commercial developers of AI models should share with the end-users of their solutions.
