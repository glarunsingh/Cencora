These public comments were submitted by HIMSS in response to the 21st Century Cures Act: Establishment of Disincentives for Health Care Providers That Have Committed Information Blocking proposed rule . The proposed rule details financial disincentives that range from $600 for an individual provider up to $165,000 for large provider groups, while Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) found to be information blocking will be removed from the Medicare Shared Savings Program for a year. The rulemaking also proposes the creation of a website that will identify organizations and the nature of the information blocking offense for providers found guilty of information blocking by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Inspector General. HIMSS supported the implementation of disincentives for providers participating in information blocking, while also suggesting CMS increase financial incentives for compliance; create tiers for financial disincentives; and provide additional education and resources for first-time information blockers found to be acting in good faith, to encourage participation in information exchange. HIMSS also recommended a robust marketing campaign to raise awareness of the proposed information blocking webpage resource. \u201cWe recognize the delicate balance the government is trying to achieve,\u201d said Tom Leary, senior vice president and head of government relations at HIMSS. \u201cGenerating disincentives will encourage participation in an interoperable ecosystem, but unnecessary burden will discourage provider participation in Medicare. \u201cGreat information exchange supports increased access to care and ultimately improves patient safety and care outcomes.

The final webinar of the year highlighted the value of having providers included in technology development. The deliverables were key culminations of our committee members\u2019 expertise and commitment to furthering the engagement of healthcare providers in digital health and emerging technologies in the healthcare information technology space. We were also well represented at the 2023 HIMSS Global Health Conference & Exhibition and virtual engagements. At the conference, the committee was highlighted at the HIMSS Connect Booth, where five of our members shared the work of the committee and why they felt volunteering to be a part of the committee was so important. Further, members coordinated with the nursing informatics committee and held a session, The Value of Clinical Informatics in Healthcare: Beyond the EHR to Interoperability. Recognizing that the time committed by our physician members was voluntary, I express my deep gratitude to each committee member for their unwavering dedication and hard work in achieving our goals this year. The successes we celebrate today are a testament to the collective efforts and commitment of our committee members. I extend special appreciation to Gwynne Jelbaoui, program manager in clinical informatics, who played a pivotal role as the linchpin of our committee. Her patient organization of our talented physician leaders has been critical to the success of our initiatives. Jelbaoui dedication and tireless efforts have been invaluable in steering the committee toward its achievements. As my tenure as committee chair concludes, I reflect with pride on the dynamic role that the HIMSS Physician Committee has played and will continue to play into the future in advancing healthcare IT for physicians. Looking forward, I am confident that the committee will not only sustain its momentum but also continue to thrive, making significant contributions to the growth and excellence of healthcare IT and its applications, particularly for and with physicians. The journey continues, and I am optimistic about the bright future ahead.

        "news_content": "The European Union has released a proposed approach for EU Cloud Services cybersecurity certification that has a limiting factor for cloud providers, particularly those that have operations spread across the EU member states or outside the EU. While acknowledging the importance of protecting patient data, HIMSS strongly recommends revisions to the EU Cloud Services Scheme\u2019s legislative framework that would allow all forms of information sharing, including the utilization of cloud solutions providers that have multiple locations, including operations outside the European Union. Efficient and timely sharing of medical records and streamlined collaboration between healthcare providers will create better patient outcomes and save lives. HIMSS urges the EU legislators to collaborate to establish a regulatory format that can ensure data can be securely processed using cloud services of providers with a legal entity in the EU subject to EU law, regardless of the existence of a legally related entity located outside the EU. \u201cWe believe strong governance systems are important to ensure data security and to respect privacy,\u201d said Hal Wolf, HIMSS President & CEO. \u201cHowever, such governance systems should avoid limiting the capacity of strong technology partners with well-established security records to collaborate on technology solutions that advance the development of efficient, secure and resilient healthcare systems.\u201d HIMSS \u2014 as a longstanding advocate for secure information sharing that supports digital transformation and works to reform the global health ecosystem through the power of information and technology \u2014 envisions a healthcare system that fosters healthcare innovation from local to global environments. Health information and technology improvements reduce provider burnout, lower healthcare costs, drive economic growth, and foster competitiveness to accelerate advancements in care delivery. HIMSS strongly supports policy initiatives that foster technological innovation, including the acceleration of cloud technology, which help to ensure patients, caregivers and clinicians benefit from seamless, secure and ubiquitous access to data that can be converted to actionable information. Recognizing the important balance between privacy, security, and access to just-in-time information sharing, HIMSS believes country-based and multi-national cloud-based services and solutions play a significant role in improving care coordination across communities as well as within and between the member states of the European Union.

Some of the oldest Indigenous cultures are tens of thousands of years old. Tribes are sovereign and independent nations with their own governments that are responsible for their populations, including their public health and the management of their population\u2019s health data in the tribe\u2019s healthcare system. Wisconsin is home to 11 federally recognized tribes, accounting for approximately 1.2% of the state population. These tribes include the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, Ho-Chunk Nation, Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, Menominee Tribe of Wisconsin, Oneida Nation, Forest County Potawatomi, Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, St. Croix Chippewa, Sokaogon Chippewa (Mole Lake) and Stockbridge-Munsee. Each tribe has its own health clinic that offers a variety of specialty services, including primary care, dental care, behavioral health, pharmacy, chiropractic care, podiatry, eye care and more. These tribes, like many Indigenous communities across the United States, face challenges around healthcare and socioeconomic disparities. Data shows that the health indicators for American Indians in Wisconsin are far worse than the health metrics of other populations in the state. Poverty is much higher, and this is seen in the national average across all tribal populations in the nation, including Wisconsin. Infant mortality is higher, life expectancy is significantly lower than other populations, and there are many diseases and illnesses that affect Native populations in Wisconsin and around the world, such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Tribal patients move in and out of non-tribal and tribal healthcare facilities, sometimes across state lines, but their health data typically does not follow them. When tribal patients have referrals out to specialists, patient data is often not connected electronically. Faxing and paper charts are still used for patient care, and the inefficiencies of these modalities contribute to lower care coordination because data is not available at the point of care. Tribes have historically not been included in health information exchanges. In Wisconsin, only the Menominee Tribe of Wisconsin, Ho-Chunk Nation and Oneida Nation are connected to the Wisconsin Statewide Health Information Network (WISHIN). Improving sharing of digital health information at the individual patient level and at clinic and system-wide levels through increased interoperability can help reduce patient and provider burden while improving health outcomes. It's important to note that each tribe faces a unique set of challenges based on their specific circumstances and history. Efforts to address challenges and close gaps in care require close collaboration between tribal governments, federal and state agencies and community organizations to improve the well-being and health of tribal members.

        "news_content": "On Nov. 11, countries around the world honor their military service members past and present by celebrating Veterans Day in the U.S. and Remembrance Day in the U.K. and the Commonwealth of Nations. In the U.S., expanding and modernizing the Department of Veteran Affairs and the Veterans Health Administration are vital to improving access to high quality care for all veterans, many of whom are nearly twice as likely to suffer from multiple chronic health conditions than their non-veteran counterparts. HIMSS President & CEO Hal Wolf has repeatedly testified to the U.S. House of Representatives and various subcommittees on how technology can help address veteran health issues. About a third of veterans enrolled in the VA report having some level of disability that prevents them from living independently. Veterans also suffer higher rates of PTSD, substance abuse and suicide than their civilian counterparts. The public agrees veterans need more healthcare support. A 2022 survey found that 86% of U.S. adults believe Congress should provide quality and affordable healthcare for veterans. To better understand how we can support our veterans, we went directly to the source and spoke with U.S. Air Force vet Blake Schnitkey, senior brand and visual designer at HIMSS. In recognition of Veterans Day, Schnitkey offered his unique insights at the intersection of healthcare, creativity and support for veterans. Can you please tell us a little about yourself? I\u2019m Blake Schnitkey, I am originally from a very small town in Ohio. I have an awesome wife, Sayward, and two kids aged 7 and 9. I am the HIMSS Senior Brand and Visual Designer. I make stuff pretty for HIMSS! Why is the work you do at HIMSS important? Like my fellow \u2018HIMSSians,\u2019 I truly believe in HIMSS\u2019s mission. And I\u2019m thrilled that we are bringing our mission to the entire globe. Working with our team around the world has been great. It\u2019s been incredible to see how far we\u2019ve grown in my 15 years at HIMSS. Tell us a little about your service. What branch of the military did you serve, and why did you decide to join? I was in the United States Air Force. Well, it\u2019s an adventure, isn\u2019t it? I enlisted in April of 2001, then 9/11 happened just before I went to boot camp. It was a surreal experience to be enlisted during all of the turmoil. Things were very uncertain. The military instills a sense of civic pride and love of country that I am very grateful for. I wish more knew the feeling unique to having served. How do you think your time in the military affected you? Number one, first and foremost, is discipline. I believe the military is a great first step in anyone\u2019s life, now having done it myself. I learned life skills, organizational skills and a love for a cause greater than myself. There is no better \u201cgraduate school\u201d in the world! Is there anything you wish civilians understood about military service? The military is often seen as an alternative to traditional work roles, and sometimes negatively. But there is no better line of work to get the absolute best in education, discipline and comradery. Military members, current and former, are some of the most trustworthy and dedicated people in the world. It really creates incredible people. Why is Veterans Day important, and how do you celebrate the day? I\u2019m still getting my feet on the ground in a new(ish) town, but I am heavily involved in the American Legion. I am a former Legion Commander of five years, so attending services as Color or Rifle Guard and shaking the hands of those who came before me is incredibly important to me. Fostering patriotism may be the legion\u2019s stated goal, but veteran support is a gigantic part of what we do. Please support your local post! What can civilians do to better support veterans on this day and year-round? Just thank a veteran. It means so much. Take the time to make that call. HIMSS is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees. Learn more about our career opportunities .

        "news_content": "The Indian Health Service (IHS), which provides comprehensive healthcare to approximately 2.8 million American Indians and Alaska Natives who belong to 574 federally recognized tribes, has announced the agency will implement Oracle Cerner technology as the new IHS enterprise electronic health record system. The new system, which replaces the 40-year-old Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS), is intended to make it easier for patients and providers to access updated and accurate health information. \u201cHIMSS strongly supports the implementation of an enterprise-wide electronic health record that will improve access to health information in a manner meeting the unique cultural needs for each tribe in the United States,\u201d said Tom Leary, senior vice president and head of government relations at HIMSS. \u201cEnsuring tribes and Urban Indian Organization partners are equipped with standards-based interoperable health information solutions is critical to advancing high-quality healthcare for generations to come.\u201d The announcement comes after a long federal acquisition process that was open to all EHR manufacturers. General Dynamics Information Technology, Inc. (GDIT) has been selected to build, configure, and maintain the new EHR system. In a press announcement on the IHS website, IHS Director Roselyn Tso said, \u201cThis is a major milestone in our work to deliver quality modern healthcare to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\u201d Tso noted better patient access to their health information and more effective care coordination were big drivers for the selection of the new EHR system. The selection of the new EHR, which coincides with Native American Heritage Month, is part of the IHS Health Information Technology Modernization Program . This was made after a federal acquisition process that coordinated with tribal and urban Indian organizations, including tribal participation in product demonstrations to ensure the selected EHR would meet the diverse health and cultural needs of tribes and advance health equity. \u201cWe are ready and eager to move forward with the enterprise EHR with our partners,\u201d said IHS Chief Information Officer and Director for the Office of Information Technology Mitchell Thornbrugh. \u201cIt is time to replace our current system and ensure that IHS is keeping pace with technological advances across the health care delivery system. \u201cThis modernization \u2013 and the technology that drives it \u2013 will impact every part of our health care delivery. Most importantly, the new EHR will enable patients and their providers to have updated and accurate information to make the best healthcare decisions.\u201d HIMSS Public Policy and Advocacy The HIMSS policy team works closely with the U.S. Congress, federal decision makers, state legislatures and governments, and other organizations to recommend policy, and legislative and regulatory solutions to improve health through information and technology.
