        "news_content": "Parkview Health, an Indiana-based hospital system, improved its patient outcomes and lowered its operational costs by implementing new, predictive algorithms into its electronic health record (EHR) monitoring system. The Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model (EMRAM) from HIMSS offered Parkview Health the framework to upgrade its algorithms with predictive analytics to help lower C. diff infections in patients and save costs. C. diff is a stool-loosening infection that requires patients to be treated with contact isolation after exposure, extending hospital stays by one to three weeks. C. diff infections are considered a massive strain on already-stretched clinical teams. In one quarter of 2017, Parkview Health experienced a peak of 43 C. diff infections. C. diff diagnoses also created unnecessary costs for the hospital and patients. Parkview Health\u2019s standard workflow procedure for diagnosing C. diff included broad-spectrum GI panels, which cost hundreds of dollars each. Specific C. diff pathway tests cost significantly less, but clinicians didn\u2019t have the decision support needed to use them confidently. Parkview quickly discovered they didn\u2019t have sufficient clinical decision support for C. diff built into their EHR. Clinicians couldn\u2019t easily narrow down the likely infections, so they used catch-all GI tract tests. With the help of the EMRAM stage 7 validation guidelines from HIMSS, Parkview created a more fine-tuned EHR process with the help of predictive analytics. They designed a workflow that aided clinicians in identifying patients with C. diff within 3 days, choosing the right C. diff for diagnosis and determining if a test is necessary. The predictive analytics program guided clinicians through a patient\u2019s digestive history, question by question. The program would then suggest what testing to complete only if the criteria for C. diff infection fit. Across the system\u2019s ten centers, Parkview Health saw an 81% decrease in C. diff events throughout a three-year period. The hospital system also saved over $990,000 over the course of two years. Clinicians at Parkview now have a better decision support system for C. diff and standard infection prevention. Learn more about this successful EMRAM implementation and its benefits for Parkview Health and patients by downloading the full case study . Digital Health Transformation HIMSS has built evidence-based models and frameworks for the sole purpose of advancing health system capability. Whether your organization is looking to improve clinical outcomes, financial viability or operational efficiencies, this is your toolkit to drive healthcare forward. Learn More",

        "news_content": "May is National Nurses Month, a time to honor and celebrate the incredible work of nurses. HIMSS is celebrating its members who are on the front lines every day. What is the organization of your employment? OKHCC and The City University of New York School of Professional Studies (CUNY SPS) What is your current position? Independent Healthcare Consultant and Adjunct Associate Professor Tell us more about your background. I am a nurse scientist, educator, and entrepreneur. My research and private practice are centered around food allergy management, policy, and innovation through the lens of informatics and leadership. Over the years, I worked in in-patient and outpatient settings, consulted for several start-up companies and taught at NY-based universities, served on boards and led committees within professional organizations, including the Health Information Management System Society (HIMSS) and the Society of Nurse Scientists, Innovators, Entrepreneurs and Leaders (SONSIEL). In 2019, I founded the Food Allergy Nursing Interest Professional Group (FANI) to provide scholarly and educational forum for nurses interested in the sub-specialty of food allergies and anaphylaxis I has been publishing peer-reviewed articles, contributing to textbooks, conducting research and mentoring nurses. I have been an active member at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) within the Anaphylaxis and Health Informatics, Technology & Education (HITE) committees. I received my Baccalaureate Degree from Hunter-Bellevue School of Nursing, Master\u2019s Degree in Nursing Informatics & Administration, as well as Doctor of Philosophy Degree from Molloy University, NY. I have been a recipient of several awards for my contributions to research, leadership, and service, and featured on Outcomes Rocket podcast in 2022. I am a Fellow at HIMSS, AAAAI and at the New York Academy of Medicine (NYAM). How do you establish a daily schedule that aligns with your values and priorities? Time management is very important in order for me to meet all of my work and family commitments yet feel content and happy with my life. I utilize my scheduling app and reminders to keep on track, including my wellness activities. For example, I enjoy taking part in a book club, but I do not always have time to read hard copies of the books, so I resort to audio versions which I can listen to while going for a walk, or when traveling. I also ask for help and delegate when appropriate. How does your organization promote wellness and self-care? Self-care is crucial for nurses to maintain their well-being and provide quality care to patients. Some strategies to promote wellness and self-care must include not only meeting physical needs such as adequate sleep, nutrition, and exercise, but also psychological and emotional needs, such as practicing relaxation techniques, using mental health resources, and practicing gratitude and self-compassion. With this in mind, I champion and support wellness initiatives not only in the workplace, but also within the professional organizations, such as HIMSS. This was our second year holding wellness breaks during the Nursing Informatics Forum at the HIMSS Annual Conference & Exhibition. What advice do you have for nurses struggling to cope with stress and burnout? It is important to remember that you are never alone, and it is okay to ask for help, especially if you already recognize exhaustion, or are feeling unappreciated or fatigued. We have the ability to set boundaries, ask for time off, seek professional help and practice self-care. We can also tap into our network of co-workers, spiritual community, family and friends who can provide us with physical, emotional or financial support, and we can seek joyful activities that can help counteract negative emotions of burnout. What support systems or resources do you recommend for nurses seeking to enhance their self-care practices? In addition to family, friends, spiritual leaders and coworkers, nurses have access to Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) to address work-related stress, professional organizations that can offer access to wellness programs, online communities where they can engage in forums or social media groups to connect with peers, and workplace wellness initiatives that are becoming more prevalent since the COVID-19 pandemic. As an informatics nurse, I also find wellness apps to be helpful if one is looking to have access to online meditation, yoga, and other digital stress management programs and tools. Is there a quote you look to for inspiration? I find this quote from Jane Fonda inspiring because it captures a holistic approach that can lead to a more balanced and fulfilling life: \u201cThe challenge is not to be perfect\u2014it is to be whole.\u201d Nurses Month is sponsored by BD.

        "news_content": "A North Carolina hospital system is making significant strides in reducing sepsis cases by using predictive analytics to standardize clinical workflows and to create a new Sepsis Watch program. Guided by the HIMSS Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model (EMRAM), Duke Health\u2019s Sepsis Watch program reduced their sepsis mortality rate by 31%. The HIMSS Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model (EMRAM) measures clinical outcomes, patient engagement and clinician use of EMR technology to strengthen organizational performance and health outcomes across patient populations.\u00a0 The internationally applicable EMRAM incorporates methodology and algorithms to score a whole hospital, including inpatient, outpatient and day case services provided on the hospital campus. Prior to their latest EMRAM validation, Duke Health faced two challenges: false sepsis alerts from their electronic health record program and a manual risk identification process for sepsis. Duke saw over 5.5 false alerts per correct alert, and only 6.8% of patients flagged by their previous program actually had sepsis. Duke Health used the EMRAM Stage 7 framework to deploy the Sepsis Watch predictive analytics model, powered by machine learning inside their established EHR program, Epic. The parameters of Sepsis Watch can be adjusted and personalized to each patient, making the program more efficient and less prone to error. Duke Health used a 32-million-point dataset built from over 42,000 inpatient encounters to train the predictive program. The EMRAM revalidation helped Duke Health create the world\u2019s first machine learning model for sepsis screening. Sepsis Watch now boasts a screening accuracy rate of 93% and dropped false sepsis diagnoses by 62%. Dr. Eugenia McPeek Hinz, Associate Chief Medical Information Officer for Duke Health said, \u201cEMRAM recertification helped us optimize our EMR, improving our patient care and the experience of our clinical team.\u201d Learn more about this successful EMRAM implementation and its benefits for Duke Health and patients by downloading the full case study .

        "news_content": "Following the final vote in the European Parliament on 24 April, the final steps will be taken toward adopting the European Health Data Space (EHDS) Regulation, which aims to\u00a0facilitate\u00a0the access, use and re-use of health data both within and across EU borders. The EHDS is one of the several EU legislative initiatives concerning data (Data Governance Act, Data Act, AI Act, Cyber Resilience Act) and the\u00a0first sectoral legislation of the proposed data spaces. \u201cWe applaud the regulations for their goals of efficient and timely sharing of medical records across borders.\u00a0 This is vital to improving patient outcomes and saving lives,\u201d said HIMSS President & CEO Hal Wolf. \u201cSignificant to the global health eco system is how the EHDS regulates patient data to help foster innovation through its secondary use, including research.\u00a0 Europe\u2019s lead in this area will be studied by all.\u201d European Health Data Space Regulation looks to foster a genuine single market for digital\u00a0health services and products\u00a0by setting up a governance structure for the use of health data for research,\u00a0innovation, policy-making and regulatory activities (i.e., secondary use of data), as well as testing and certification process to ensure that such data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). Over the past two years, various points and topics of\u00a0the\u00a0Regulation have been debated, among which the key points were: Patients will have the right to opt out of their anonymized or pseudonymized health data being made accessible for secondary use . Member States may allow patients to opt out of data being made available for primary use by a healthcare professional other than the one(s) who collected it. Where one organization holds a significant volume of data that may be of interest for secondary use, they may be designated as trusted data holders by a Member State to assist with data access request administration and reduce the burden on Health Data Access Bodies. In terms of the next steps, the Regulation will enter 20 days after publication in the Official Journal of the EU, which is expected in the next month. This will mark the start of the implementation timeline, which requires Member States to gradually implement the law, starting with the creation of the Health Data Access Bodies and Digital Health Authorities by mid-2026, allowing primary use of patient summaries, ePrescription and eDispensation by mid-2028, and secondary use of such data by 2030. Additional non-EU countries, such as the United States, may participate in EHDS starting in 2030. HIMSS\u00a0will continue to be a resource for the EU health community and members\u00a0on this and other EU Regulations, which will be widely discussed in the many policy-focused sessions at HIMSS24 European Health Conference and Exhibition , taking place from 29-31 May 2024, in Rome.
