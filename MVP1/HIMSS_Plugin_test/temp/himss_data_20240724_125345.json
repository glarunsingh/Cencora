        "news_content": "The HIMSS Arizona Chapter recently hosted a cohort of students studying healthcare at Bryan University on a trip to Washington, D.C., for an inside look at policy and advocacy. The students visited the HIMSS office in Virginia to learn about some of the current public policy priorities being led by the HIMSS Government Relations team. Arizona Chapter Advocate Marjorie Rosen organized the trip as part of the HIMSS Chapter Advocacy Program, which leverages HIMSS\u2019s reach and resources to influence public policy to advance healthcare and population health for all. Marci Little, a health administration student at Bryan University, class of 2025, wrote the following summary of her experience. The healthcare students from Bryan University were given the opportunity to be in Washington, D.C., for a week from April 12-18. We were invited to participate in the school\u2019s Paralegal Program trip. We got the chance to see memorials, monuments, The Supreme Court, Capitol Hill and so many other sites. For me, I was so glad to be able to see the monuments and memorials, but what I wasn\u2019t prepared for was the amazing experience of advocating through HIMSS. This was the best most memorable part of the week for me! For three nights of the trip, we were given the basics of what advocacy is, how it works and what to expect by Marjorie Rosen, Program Director of Healthcare. Everyone had the opportunity to ask questions regarding advocacy and how it works. I knew about advocacy as I had to do a PPE in advocacy to get my associate\u2019s degree. I started to see myself advocating after that assignment. My love of advocacy was fueled during this trip! We attended a meeting with HIMSS in D.C. They showed us everything they possibly could about advocacy. It was beyond amazing! I fell in love with advocacy. We met some amazing people and even got to take a few photos with them. Questions were asked and answered while each of us took notes, mentally or written. We had the chance to see Marjorie teach alongside the HIMSS group regarding what the MATCH IT Act is and how we could help. For our advocacy day on Capitol Hill, we were split into groups. Our job was to meet with our representatives and get them on board with the MATCH IT Act. I had the pleasure of being the speaker of our group at each of our meetings. I am not a great speaker, but I found my voice in advocating. If I took anything from this trip, it is that advocacy is needed to change things, whether it\u2019s in healthcare, government or in your own life. I am so grateful for the opportunity we had to be a part of this during that week. If given the opportunity again, I would gladly take it!

        "news_content": "President Biden\u2019s Fiscal Year 2025 (FY2025) proposed budget for the U.S. Health and Hyman Services (HHS) included $86 million for the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), an increase of $17 million above the FY2024 enacted level. As Congress begins to draft their annual spending bills, HIMSS led a multi-stakeholder initiative urging the leaders of the Labor, HHS, and Related Agencies (Labor-HHS) Appropriations subcommittees to fully fund ONC at the president\u2019s proposed FY25 budget request. This increase in funding would help advance interoperability and nationwide, standards-based health information exchange to support better health enabled by data. Read the full letter to congressional appropriations . HIMSS, along with AHIMA and CHIME, led the joint effort that garnered over 50 signers. The letter explained that this necessary funding boost would provide the agency with the resources they have long needed to better serve as the key partner to both public and private sector stakeholders to advance the health information and technology ecosystem. Without this much-needed increase, the organizations worry that they will be hard-pressed to successfully execute the many agency initiatives, and priorities of Congress and the Administration. ONC supports a wide array of initiatives aimed at advancing national goals for better, safer, and more equitable healthcare through a nationwide interoperable health IT infrastructure. These include ensuring technology solutions incorporate baseline cybersecurity and privacy requirements, a health equity by design philosophy for federal health IT programs, continued advancements in patient access to health information and meaningful engagement in their care, and working to advance U.S. public health data infrastructure modernization.

        "news_title": "Office for Civil Rights Announces Final Rule to Protect Reproductive Healthcare Data Privacy",
        "news_date": "2024-05-24T19:16:14.000000Z",
        "news_content": "On April 22, 2024, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) finalized its rule, HIPAA Privacy Rule to Support Reproductive Health Care Privacy . The rule aims to improve patient data protections around lawful reproductive health care services, thereby encouraging patients to seek these services when necessary and improve patient trust in the healthcare system. HIMSS strongly supports the overall goals of this rule, which specifically \u201cprohibits uses and disclosures of protected health information (PHI) for criminal, civil, or administrative investigations or proceedings against individuals\u201d for seeking, obtaining, providing or facilitating reproductive healthcare that is lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided. HIMSS applauds OCR\u2019s decisions to properly educate covered entities about this rule, to provide a model attestation in advance of the rule\u2019s compliance date of December 23, 2024, and to educate patients through, for example, requiring the patient\u2019s Notice of Privacy Protections form to be made available in multiple languages. HIMSS continues to encourage OCR to explore health IT solutions for delivering the Notice of Privacy Protections and other privacy education resources to patients in culturally inclusive ways. HIMSS anticipates that several provisions of the final rule may present challenges for ubiquitous information exchange in a manner that also provides the appropriate protections for patients. In a public comment letter responding to the proposed rule from June 16, 2023, HIMSS called on OCR to expand these protections to patients receiving all forms of healthcare. HIMSS believes that healthcare information should not be used unfairly against patients and determining who has access and reasons for access should be the same for all healthcare interventions, not only for reproductive health care services. OCR did not adopt HIMSS\u2019s recommendation, however HIMSS will continue to advocate for these protections for patients in future public comment opportunities. HIMSS also raised concerns about the challenges to parse out reproductive health data and protect those data in a different manner than other healthcare data, as required in the Final Rule. Healthcare organizations report significant operational challenges segregating certain types of personal health information (PHI) from other PHI. OCR acknowledges this challenge, however, asserts that this is critical to improve patient protections for reproductive health, as this specific type of data may unfairly target patients in the current US political landscape. OCR broadly defined reproductive health services, with a non-exhaustive list of examples of services, which aims to make this process easier. OCR also asserts that this rule should not increase data segmentation concerns beyond those that already exist. HIMSS recommends continued work at ONC to improve data sharing and segmentation standards to reduce unnecessary administrative burden and costs on health systems. Overall, HIMSS is highly pleased with OCR\u2019s final rule and recognizes the importance of protecting reproductive health data, which would improve patient trust and willingness to receive lawful reproductive health care services. HIMSS regularly analyzes and seeks comments on federal regulations. HIMSS members interested in contributing to comment letters, please reach out to policy@himss.org.

What is the organization of your employment? Advocate Health What is your current position? Director of Advanced Analytics Tell us more about your background. Throughout my career as a Nurse Informaticist I have been fortunate to be an early adopter of several of the emerging trends in the field. After graduating with my Bachelor\u2019s degree from Clemson University in 2001, I worked at the bedside in both ICU and the ED. I have always loved computers, from the Commodore 64 days to today, and I have kept my skills as an advanced hobbyist. In 2005 I started seeing a multitude of vendors coming in and showing their products. Most of them were clearly designed by people with no idea what clinicians do or how we do it. I tried to get involved but lacked the network or credentials to be taken seriously. So, I returned to school to pursue a Master\u2019s in Nursing Informatics at Duke University. Upon graduation in December of 2006, I quickly was accepted into an entry level position as an informaticist. From 2006 to 2013 I had the wonderful experience of building, testing, and implementing a modern EMR, with all of the bell-and-whistles of the day, including CPOE, barcode medication administration, best practice alerts, data interchange with other EMRs, and everything in between. This started two years before the Hi-Tech Act made people in my role much more commonplace. After having implemented this technology at multiple hospitals and moving into more of a support and enhancement role, I began to fully understand the power of data. I began to conclude the power of my job wasn\u2019t so much making the lives of nurses and other clinicians easier by making technology work for them, though that is important. Instead, I began to see what the power of data in decision making and patient care could do. I took a keen interest in advocating for better reports and analytics. I think I bothered the Reporting and Analytics team so much that their VP finally asked me to become a director for him so we could achieve greater things. In 2013 I accepted this challenge knowing nothing about reporting and little about analytics, except that what the technical team was doing was suboptimal. Instead of a new degree to transition me to the new space, I had to rely on my Informatics skills, as I spend many hours in the evenings and weekends learning the technical ins-and-outs of Reporting and Analytics. Even before I had those new skills sharpened, just leveraging my Nursing Informatics knowledge improved our products greatly. We started organizing and creating a well thought out library of reports. We partnered with the clinicians to understand their clinical priorities and developed analytics so that they could measure their success and identify areas of opportunities. My career in Reporting and Analytics has included Clinical, Revenue Cycle, Quality, and Cost. Each one of those is a specialty unto itself, not unlike a clinical specialty. While I don\u2019t encounter many other nurses working in this space, it is ripe for expansion. The technical teams are greatly skilled, but they don\u2019t have the Informatics skills needed to maximize the potential of their work while minimizing the amount of rework. Some Informaticists ask if I am really an Informaticist. Well, I use all 17 Standards delineated in the Nursing Informatics Scope and Standards of Practice (3rd edition) and several not listed. Some ask if a nursing license is required for my job. No, but then again, in 2006 it wasn\u2019t either. (And they didn\u2019t call us Nurse Informaticists.) I maintain my license, and I am a nurse. My education, experience, and credentials should make that self-evident. Reporting and Analytics is a great space, and one not well served by RNs. I hope more will join me! Is there a leader you follow for inspiration? Or is there a nursing leader that has inspired your career? Linda Goodwin was my advisor in graduate school. She encouraged me so much to follow my interests, even when they were unorthodox. We were talking about handheld gaming one time and wondered if it could be leveraged for nurses in some way. I turned that into a capstone project where I developed a way to put nursing education lectures in a PlayStation Portable (PSP). She encouraged me not to limit myself to what was common and readily available to me, but to use tools the industry wasn't using and to do common things in an uncommon way. I have run into so many great leaders along the way, some nurses, some not and I try to learn something new from each of them. What characteristics describe a strong nursing informatics leader? Nurses are the masters of getting stuff done. A strong informatics leader sets the vision of what needs to be done, provides the tools to do it, then helps remove roadblocks that are preventing the task from being successful. They encourage and support creative problem solving and creating the future. How do you leverage mentorship and guidance from experienced informaticists to further your career and skill set? I view the reporting and analytics space as the other side of the coin from the traditional informatics space. In order to be successful, I have to work with informatics leaders developing new tools. I can also tell them the issues I am having and the data I need to be more successful so that they can design that into the front-end. Experienced informaticists are able to project the strengths and weaknesses of new technologies and can separate marketing hype from clinical effectiveness. In what ways do you see ongoing professional development benefiting the broader nursing informatics community and advancing the field as a whole? Professional development is key for all nurses. Our field is changing so fast that we cannot rely purely on experience though we can let experience be a guide. I see professional development as helping keep me current with technological advances, I see it promoting innovation as I learn more about new technology and think of ways it can be leveraged. It helps support evidence-based practice, which enhances both informatics and clinical practice. Nurses Month is sponsored by BD.

        "news_content": "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and the bi-partisan Senate artificial intelligence working group released a legislative framework for artificial intelligence policy on May 15. The plan called for $32 billion in annual spending to stimulate AI research and innovation and a stand-alone federal data privacy law focused on AI. The $32 billion in annual non-defense AI spending aligns with recommendations made by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) report published in 2021. The four-person Senate working group, consisting of Schumer, fellow Democratic senator Martin Heinrich, and Republicans Mike Rounds and Todd Young, endorsed several areas of focus to target while increasing current funding to match NSCAI recommended levels by 2026. Those areas include: Cross-government focus on AI research and development of \u201cAI ready data initiative,\u201d including foundational trustworthy AI topics, such as transparency, explainability, privacy, interoperability and security Fully fund the CHIPS and Science Act accounts related to AI Passing the Create AI Act (S. 4236) to authorize the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) Passing the Future of AI Innovation Act (S. 4178) and the AI Grand Challenges Act (S. 4236) to fund a series of \u201cAI Grand Challenges\u201d to promote AI innovation Funding an AI evaluation infrastructure at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and supporting the creation of a NIST testbed to test and synthesize innovation AI tools Supporting research and development for the intersection of AI and critical infrastructure (like healthcare) Funding AI work through Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) Develop legislation related to training, retraining and upskilling the private sector workforce to successfully participate in an AI-enabled economy Specific to healthcare, the working group recommended passing legislation to: Support deployment of AI in healthcare Implement guardrails and safety measures to protect patients, including consumer protection, preventing fraud and abuse and promoting the usage of accurate and representative data Support NIH development and improvement of AI, particularly data governance Ensure that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). can create a predictable regulatory structure for AI-enabled tools Provide transparency for providers and the public about the use of AI in medical products and clinical support services, including the data used to train the AI models Promote innovation of AI systems, potentially through Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reimbursement that meaningfully improve health outcomes and efficiencies In addition to exploring the creation of a national data privacy law, the working group recommended that the Congressional committees of jurisdiction should consider if additional standards or clarity around existing standards are needed to hold AI developers and users accountable if AI tools cause hard to consumers. HIMSS Public Policy and Advocacy The HIMSS policy team works closely with the U.S. Congress, federal decision makers, state legislatures and governments, and other organizations to recommend policy, and legislative and regulatory solutions to improve health through information and technology.
