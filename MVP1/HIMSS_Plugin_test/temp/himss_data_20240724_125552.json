What is the organization of your employment? BD What is your current position? Director Clinical Care, Medical Affairs Tell us more about your background. My background includes 20 years of diverse nursing experience through which my role in nursing has grown from a certified nursing assistant to a master prepared nurse. I now serve in a unique role as a medical affairs leader at BD. Immediately prior to joining BD, I served as the Senior Director of Strategic Program Development at CommonSpirit where I led various specialty programs and technology adoption. My most recent education was completed at Johns Hopkins University where I earned dual master's degrees in nursing and business administration. The dual master's program at JHU provided me the unique opportunity to collaborate with leaders from Stanford Healthcare, Dartmouth Health and the University of California San Diego Health. My professional organization involvement includes HIMSS, AONL, ANA, ANCL, and AORN. Can you share a significant milestone or time you are most proud of within your career? Serving in a leadership role through the COVID pandemic served as a significant milestone in my career. The experience helped to shape me as a nursing leader as I navigated the adversity of the pandemic and learned what it truly means to be resilient, courageous, and compassionate. Within your profession, what do you hope to accomplish in the future? My personal mission is to continue to advocate for the nursing profession and practice at the national and global level. Through collaboration and partnership with leaders across the globe, I aim to arm nurses with the tools necessary to deliver high quality care. In your opinion, what actions or initiatives do you believe would be most effective in fostering a culture of recognition and appreciation for nurses, not only during Nurses Month but throughout the entire year? Nurses are the heart of health care, and it is important that they are well represented professionally. Nurses want to be heard; therefore, it is important to provide them with opportunities to share their insight and provide feedback thereby ultimately giving them a seat at the proverbial table. Nurses Month is sponsored by BD. Join Us as We Reimagine Health Through Information and Technology At HIMSS, our vision is to realize the full health potential of every human, everywhere.
