        "news_date": "2024-04-05T21:39:05.000000Z",
        "news_content": "HIMSS hosted a Native American Health IT Symposium at the 2024 HIMSS Global Health Conference & Exhibition in March, delving into tribal public health needs; respecting tribal data sovereignty; tribal data modernization plans by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Oracle Health & General Dynamics Information Technology electronic health record implementation strategies; and advocacy opportunities. The symposium was headlined by an Indian Health Service (IHS) keynote on its current health IT modernization initiative to overhaul a 40-year-old EHR software system currently in use by IHS-funded facilities. IHS representatives Deputy CIO Andrea Scott, Division of Health IT Modernization Director Jeanette Kompkoff and Chief Information Security Officer Benjamin Koshy provided in-depth updates on their new central repository for clinical data and how the organization is preparing for to convert to the commercial EHR go-lives expected in late 2025. U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, who is one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress, sent a video message to symposium attendees, sharing her excitement about HIMSS\u2019s leadership in bringing together federal and tribal partners to improve Native health through policy and health innovation. A larger goal of the HIMSS Native American and Indigenous People\u2019s Community \u2014 which was launched in 2023 \u2014 is to address global issues, and the 2024 symposium had the distinct honor of including Canada Health Infoway to provide updates on its efforts to connect with First Nations and Indigenous Peoples across the Canadian provinces. Following the launch of the new community last year, HIMSS hosted an in-person roundtable at the 2023 HIMSS Global Conference in Chicago, Illinois, to gauge interest in the community and to discuss tribal healthcare opportunities and challenges. The roundtable was standing room only, proving there was not only interest but a clear need for space for tribes to convene, collaborate and learn. Prior to these extremely successful activities, the largest Native American health IT event hosted by HIMSS took place about a decade ago. Robert Coffey, a Comanche Nation citizen and longstanding HIMSS Oklahoma Chapter tribal liaison, and Tom Kauley, Kiowa Nation citizen and National Indian Health Board (NIHB) Regional Extension Center coordinator, worked together to bring Native health IT issues to the forefront of the HIMSS 2013 Conference & Exhibition. Kauley had a vision for NIHB and HIMSS to work together to meet tribal health IT needs for Native American and Indigenous populations. But in September 2013, Kauley suddenly passed away. At the time, HIMSS Senior Vice President and Head of Government Relations Tom Leary told Coffey he would not forget about him and Kauley and their efforts. Leary made a promise to embark on a journey for HIMSS again to lead a tribally focused event and to be an advocate for tribal communities. Ten years later, Coffey resurfaced the idea for HIMSS and NIHB to work together on tribal health IT issues. He worked with the HIMSS Government Relations team to revive the Native American Health IT Symposium for the 2024 HIMSS Global Conference. Kauley\u2019s original vision came full circle. During the 2024 symposium, Coffey paid homage to his late friend Kauley with personal stories and reflections. Coffey also honored Leary and HIMSS Senior Government Relations Specialist Evan Dunne on stage in a blanketing ceremony \u2014 a Native American tradition to symbolize unity, celebration and partnership \u2014 to thank them for honoring Kauley and bringing the vision to life. Leary made Coffey a promise 10 years ago, and the 2024 Native American Health IT Symposium fulfilled that promise. HIMSS has also strengthened its partnership with NIHB, working with in close collaboration, and NIHB gave an overview at the symposium of the current legislative landscape of Indian Country in the United States. NIHB was pivotal in the planning process to help promote the symposium to its members. HIMSS is proud to honor Native American and Indigenous peoples with continued advocacy for tribal communities, working collaboratively to ensure tribes are never forgotten. Anyone interested in tribal healthcare and health information and technology is invited to join the HIMSS Native American and Indigenous Peoples Community . The community is committed to educating and equipping tribal leaders and tribal health professionals with culturally informed resources designed to help improve health outcomes and enhance access and opportunities within Native American and Indigenous people\u2019s healthcare. Gather with fellow visionaries and health equity advocates to improve the delivery of care and transform tribal health. HIMSS members are also welcome to join the HIMSS Global Health Equity Network , an initiative focused on advancing diversity and inclusion to ensure health and wellness for everyone, everywhere.

        "news_content": "HIMSS co-led a stakeholder letter April 2 urging the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to expeditiously issue a revised proposed rule on the prescribing of controlled substances through telehealth as soon as possible. The stakeholder letter , also co-led by the Alliance for Connected Care, the American Telemedicine Association and ATA Action, the Consumer Technology Association and the Partnership to Advance Virtual Care, was signed by 214 stakeholders. The current flexibilities allowing for the remote prescribing of controlled substances, which were implemented in response to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE), are set to expire at the end of this year. Without regulatory action, these flexibilities will end and patients and providers risk experiencing significant lapses in care. The letter urged DEA to release the updated proposed rules as soon as possible for the following reasons: Ensure stakeholders have adequate time to provide feedback on any policy proposal. If DEA were to create a special registration process for telehealth prescribers, as proposed by DEA and many stakeholders, substantial operational lead-time would be needed to implement the new process and comply with other potential operational requirements and guardrails. A rulemaking late in the year that makes significant policy changes would affect the ability of patients and clinicians to make appointments and ensure consistent access to care. There will be operational staff training needs for pharmacies and other parts of the healthcare delivery system to ensure patients uninterrupted access to needed medical treatments offered through telehealth. DEA\u2019s national leadership is needed to set a clear path forward for the nation and to encourage more consistent definitions and aligned requirements from state regulatory bodies \u2014 to encourage care in our most underserved areas, without geographic barriers limiting access to care. Prior the expiration of the PHE in May 2023, the DEA initially released proposed rules that were met with switch public backlash \u2014 over 38,000 public comments \u2014 and had to temporarily extend the PHE flexibilities through Nov. 11, 2023. The DEA followed that temporary extension by further extending the full set of telemedicine flexibilities through Dec. 31, 2024, coinciding with the expiration of the Medicare telehealth PHE flexibilities. While the DEA works to develop new proposed rules that will make permanent changes to the prescribing of controlled medications, continuing the PHE flexibilities will help ensure a smooth transition for patients and practitioners that have come to rely on telemedicine. HIMSS and the 214 co-signers are urging the DEA to release these proposed rules as soon as possible to ensure the voices or patients and providers are heard and avoid any unnecessary and harmful disruption to patients accessing the care they need through telemedicine. HIMSS Public Policy and Advocacy The HIMSS policy team works closely with the U.S. Congress, federal decision makers, state legislatures and governments, and other organizations to recommend policy, and legislative and regulatory solutions to improve health through information and technology.

        "news_content": "A California-based healthcare provider has produced two data governance standards to reach their goal of evaluating and integrating ethical artificial intelligence models into their clinical operations. With the help of the HIMSS Adoption Model for Analytics Maturity (AMAM), the University of California, Davis Health (UC Davis) used the AMAM maturity model frameworks to spot gaps in their data governance and pioneer a framework for ethical health AI. The HIMSS Adoption Model for Analytics Maturity (AMAM) measures the analytics capabilities that healthcare organizations have gained from having a strong analytics strategy and competency. UC Davis used these frameworks to create cohesive data governance with system-wide data standards and informatics workflows. After building a novel data governance program to define best practices, standardize workflows, and increase literacy, UC Davis created S.M.A.R.T. and S.A.F.E., a clinical evaluation framework for health AI governance. Like most healthcare systems, UC Davis didn\u2019t have an efficient procedure in place to classify which machine learning models were safe, unbiased, and effective. The development of S.M.A.R.T. and S.A.F.E. allowed UC Davis practitioners to ensure that any machine learning model that might impact patients or providers was safe, accurate, fair, and evidence-based. With the help of AMAM, UC Davis was able to set up complete data governance in place of a more siloed data strategy. Their new analytics foundation paved the way for the S.M.A.R.T. and S.A.F.E. framework, which to date has successfully identified 25 AI models for implementation and 5 AI models that were not deemed suitable for implementation in clinical operations. As the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning continues to skyrocket across the healthcare industry, health systems need more frameworks like UC Davis\u2019s S.M.A.R.T. and S.A.F.E. to better understand the risks, biases, and ethical issues around using AI models. The partnership between UC Davis and HIMSS is helping to set a new standard and framework for the ethical use of AI in healthcare.

The announcement, which coincided with the publication of a memo by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), indicates federal agencies will be required to appoint a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (CAIO), create an AI governance group of agency leaders, and utilize minimum measures to mitigate risk to public safety and risk to individual rights associated with agency use of AI. The HIMSS policy team has created a fact sheet with the minimum requirements for federal agency deployment and use of artificial intelligence. The framework, which doesn\u2019t apply rules driven process systems whose behavior is defined only by human-defined rules to produce the same calculation when the same data is ingested, defines covered AI as: Any artificial system that performs tasks under varying and unpredictable circumstances without significant human oversight or that can learn from experience and improve performance when exposed to data sets. An artificial system developed in computer software, physical hardware, or other context that solves tasks requiring human-like perception, cognition, planning, learning, communication or physical action. An artificial system designed to think or act like a human, including cognitive architectures and neural networks. A set of techniques, including machine learning, that is designed to approximate a cognitive task. An artificial system designed to act rationally, including an intelligent software agent or embodied robot that achieves goals using perception, planning, reasoning, learning, communicating, decision making and acting. To utilize covered AI tools, federal agencies must complete an AI impact assessment for each tool and real-world testing for each AI tool, to be vetted by the new CAIO and AI governance structure for each agency. Any AI tools demonstrating unacceptable risks to safety or individual rights must be shut down and removed from agency work processes unless the AI tool meets specified exemption criteria. The OMB guidance also requires federal agencies to revalidate AI performance on an annual basis starting in December 2024. The OMB memo also requires federal agencies to establish a CAIO within 60 days, with a deadline of May 27, 2025, and to publicly issue (on the agency\u2019s website) the agency plan for compliance with the minimum practices for mitigating risks to safety and individual rights within 180 days (Sept. 24, 2025.)

In 2023, more than 70 health systems achieved Stage 6 and 7 validations on four HIMSS maturity models. The Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model (EMRAM) helps systems assess how they're adopting and using EMRs to support patients and clinicians. Insights help deliver personalized care at scale, reduce medication errors, speed up clinical operations and ensure data security. The Adoption Model for Analytics Maturity (AMAM) helps measure analytics capabilities and how they\u2019re being used. AMAM insights provide guidance in creating a solid data infrastructure and strategy, managing data assets and improving performance. The recently modernized Infrastructure Adoption Model (INFRAM) helps improve tech infrastructure to achieve goals while meeting international benchmarks and standards. An in-depth assessment of health infrastructure and a strategic technology plan for specific goals include clinical operations, patient outcomes, data security and more. On the HIMSS maturity models, Stage 7 is the highest level of achievement. A successful Stage 7 validation confirms an organization has fully implemented and effectively leveraged technologies to improve patient care and achieve meaningful outcomes. The validation signifies a high level of sophistication and maturity in leveraging health information technology to drive improvements in healthcare delivery.
