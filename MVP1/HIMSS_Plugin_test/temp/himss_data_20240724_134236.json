        "news_date": "2024-02-27T15:09:58.000000Z",
        "news_content": "HIMSS is celebrating Black History Month by spotlighting HIMSS members who are making a difference for underrepresented minority communities. HIMSS has supported its members in initiatives to remedy racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare like the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021 , the annual Global Health Equity Week , and celebrating black excellence at the HIMSS Global Conference & Exhibition. Today, HIMSS is highlighting Burgess Harrison. Burgess is the executive director at the National Minority Health Association. What inspired you to pursue a career in health IT, and how has your journey contributed to advancements in the field, particularly for underrepresented communities? My journey in health IT began in the 1990s with a vision to address fraud, waste, and abuse in homecare through an automated system known then as telephony, now referred to as Electronic Visit Verification (EVV). This innovation, now mandated by Congress since 2016, replaced outdated paper processes, ensuring accurate and fair payroll for homecare workers and patients and in particular underserved populations. According to a 2021 report by UCSF Health Workforce Research Center on Long-Term Care, EVV has significantly impacted personal care services.\u00a0 EVV has been crucial in modernizing healthcare administration, saving millions of dollars and administrative hours, thus allowing better focus on care. Can you share a specific initiative or project you've been involved in within the industry that has positively impacted addressing health disparities or improving healthcare access for marginalized populations? In 2021, I led an initiative at the National Minority Health Association funded by an $11 million HRSA grant, aimed at increasing COVID-19 vaccine accessibility in hesitant and underserved communities. This project involved collaborating with nearly 2,000 home health and homecare agencies across the United States. Originally operational in 12 states, the program's success led to its expansion to all 50 states. We developed a custom AWS database in just six weeks to manage security, verify vaccinations, facilitate incentives, and gather responses to 29 required HRSA survey questions for each participant. Our efforts met the grant's objectives and significantly enhanced vaccine access for marginalized populations.\u00a0 We were told that we were one of HRSA\u2019s most innovative COVID19 grants. How do you envision the future of healthcare technology playing a role in promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within the industry? Are there specific areas where you see opportunities for positive change? Healthcare technology is poised to significantly enhance healthcare delivery, particularly for marginalized and underserved populations, by improving efficiency and reducing costs. However, challenges such as the risk of implicit bias in AI highlight the need for careful refinement and structured guidelines. Our initiatives like \"Operation Healthy\u2122 You\" aim to curate health apps and services to provide greater access and optimize health outcomes. Additionally, our \"Equityville\u2122\" program is designed to bridge the technological gap for these populations, transitioning from traditional web interfaces to immersive experiences like web 3.0, AR, and VR. With our Memory Impairment Engagement Framework (MI-EF) we've proposed utilizes AI and ML to improve care for individuals with memory impairments, emphasizing inclusivity, data privacy, and collaborative management. These developments underscore our commitment to leveraging technology for greater equity and inclusion in healthcare. Join Us as We Reimagine Health Through Information and Technology At HIMSS, our vision is to realize the full health potential of every human, everywhere. Be part of the community that\u2019s transforming the global health ecosystem with courage, curiosity and determination. Be part of what\u2019s next for health",

        "news_content": "Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA) and Rep. Bill Foster (D-IL) introduced a bill on Feb. 15 in the U.S. House of Representatives that would seek to improve patient safety and privacy issues by address the problem of patient misidentification within the healthcare ecosystem. The Patient Matching and Transparency in Certified Health IT ( MATCH IT) Act of 2024 ( H . R . 7379) would create an industry standard definition for the term \u201cpatient match rate\u201d and would ensure accurate matching of patients with their medical record by improving standardization of patients\u2019 demographic information entered into certified health IT products. \u201cHIMSS is a proud supporter of the MATCH IT Act, which would improve patient safety and enhance care coordination by tackling a critical issue affecting our healthcare ecosystem \u2014 patient misidentification,\u201d said HIMSS President & CEO Hal Wolf. \u201cWe applaud Reps. Mike Kelly and Bill Foster for their continued leadership on this important issue and urge Congress to prioritize patient safety by passing this important legislation.\u201d Representatives Kelly and Foster worked with the Patient ID Now Coalition , a group of healthcare organizations including HIMSS as a founding member, to develop the MATCH IT Act . Patient ID Now represents a wide range of healthcare stakeholders committed to advancing a nationwide strategy to address patient identification through legislation and regulations. Patient misidentification and matching errors within the U.S. healthcare system have long threatened the safety and privacy of patients and continues to drive unnecessary costs to patients and providers. The inability of clinicians to ensure patients are accurately matched with their medical records has resulted in medical errors, including patient deaths, and patients often undergo unnecessary repeated medical tests. According to Black Book Research, the expense of repeated medical care due to duplicate records costs an average of $1,950 per patient inpatient stay and more than $1,700 per emergency department visit. Thirty-five percent of all denied claims result from inaccurate patient identification, costing the average hospital $2.5 million and the US healthcare system more than $6.7 billion annually. Finding solutions to address patient misidentification and matching errors has long been a priority for HIMSS and our members and will continue to be a top advocacy priority until the problem is addressed. The introduction of this bipartisan bill is a great first step, and the HIMSS government relations team will continue to support patients and providers by advocating for policy changes that improve patient matching and identification. Write to members of Congress and ask that they support this legislation . HIMSS Public Policy and Advocacy The HIMSS policy team works closely with government decision makers and our stakeholders to advance policy solutions to achieve the HIMSS mission to reform the global health ecosystem through the power of information and technology.

HIMSS has supported its members in initiatives to lessen racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare like the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021 , the annual Global Health Equity Week , and celebrating black excellence at the HIMSS Global Conference & Exhibition. Today, HIMSS is highlighting Angela Ross, DNP, MPH, PMP, DASM, PHCNS-BC, FHIMSS. Angela is the assistant professor, director doctorate in Health Informatics at UTHealth Houston McWilliams School of Biomedical Informatics. Angela will also be a speaker at the upcoming 2024 HIMSS Global Conference & Exhibition, supporting the Nursing Informatics Forum . What inspired you to pursue a career in health IT, and how has your journey contributed to advancements in the field, particularly for underrepresented communities? After retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel from the US Army Nurse Corps and the Defense Health Agency, I eagerly embraced a new chapter at McWilliams School of Biomedical Informatics at UTHealth Houston. In my previous role as chief medical information officer, I spearheaded the selection and implementation of IT systems across military medical treatment facilities. At UTHealth Houston, I leverage my extensive clinical knowledge and experience in teaching, evaluation, process improvement, implementation, and workforce development. My sincere goal is to nurture future leaders in informatics by teaching the importance of evidence-based practice, innovation, and critical thinking. My passion for applied/clinical informatics was ignited during my tenure in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at a US Army Medical Center. At the time, the hospital was on the cusp of implementing Electronic Health Records (EHR), and I seized the opportunity to join the committee overseeing this transition. This experience, particularly the collaboration with the interdisciplinary team, was pivotal in shaping my interest and subsequent career in Health Informatics. Can you share a specific initiative or project you've been involved in within the industry that has positively impacted addressing health disparities or improving healthcare access for marginalized populations? Contributing my expertise and time to various health care organizations has enabled me to stay updated with the dynamic healthcare landscape and actively improve patient care and services. My contributions span multiple organizations and initiatives, including the grant-funded Health Care for the Homeless Houston (HHH), the Gaining Equity in Training for Public Health Informatics and Technology program, and the Texas Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences' Community Engagement Component. These grant-funded programs are focused on historically marginalized communities, including Black/African-American and Hispanic/Latinx populations throughout Texas. How do you envision the future of healthcare technology playing a role in promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within the industry? Are there specific areas where you see opportunities for positive change? In envisioning the future, health care technology must be developed and implemented with a strong focus on all. This requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including policymakers, health care providers, technologists, and community representatives, to ensure that technology is a tool for bridging gaps in health care. Through deliberate and inclusive approaches, health care technology can be a powerful ally in improving outcomes for all. Future developments must focus on creating algorithms trained on diverse datasets to ensure that AI-driven diagnostics, treatment recommendations, and patient management tools are equitable. Technology can facilitate better engagement with communities through platforms that allow for direct feedback, community health initiatives, and participatory design processes involving community members in developing health interventions and technologies. Join Us as We Reimagine Health Through Information and Technology At HIMSS, our vision is to realize the full health potential of every human, everywhere. Be part of the community that\u2019s transforming the global health ecosystem with courage, curiosity and determination. Be part of what\u2019s next for health",

        "news_content": "Experts will deliver solutions to healthcare\u2019s greatest challenges and important niche issues at the 2024 HIMSS Global Health Conference & Exhibition from March 11-15, 2024, in Orlando, Florida. All HIMSS24 sessions are selected through a highly competitive peer review process and are available for continuing education credits. In addition to hot topics such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, interoperability, and policy, many HIMSS24 cutting-edge sessions target specialty areas such as sustainability and sensitive subjects including mental health, addiction, handling sexual orientation and gender identity data in electronic health records and more. Explore the full program and learn more about these engaging sessions. Using Artificial Intelligence to Reduce Carbon Footprint of Healthcare Facilities Speaker: Mubaraka Ibrahim, Acting Chief Information Officer at Emirates Health Services Establishment Emirates Health Services is pioneering in sustainability efforts, and one of the key programs built is a first-of-its-kind AI solution to measure and reduce the carbon footprint of the health system. There were an estimated savings of 1.4 billion grams of CO2 by EHS in 2022, with the help of AI and an eHealth strategy, which is targeted for further reduction. Reengineering Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Workflows in Response to\u00a0Novel Legislation Speakers: Charu Dhavalikar, Director of Medical Informatics at Hackensack Meridian Health and Lauren Koniaris, Chief Medical Informatics Officer at Hackensack Meridian Health In 2022, the State of New Jersey passed novel legislation mandating the collection of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) data by acute care hospitals. The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Department at Hackensack Meridian Health spearheaded a workgroup to develop multiple operational, educational and technical updates, and ensure compliance with the law. After initial go-live, a number of downstream concerns and challenges were identified in the EMR. These were addressed through further technical updates, allowing for a successful go-live and a large increase in SOGI data collection. A Culturally Sensitive Approach to Acute Mental Health and Addiction Care Speaker: Kelsey Sjaarda, Clinical Program Manager, The Link at Avera McKennan Hospital & University Health Center This presentation will examine the work of a community triage center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, that provides 24/7 care and support for individuals struggling with mental health crises and addiction, with a patient population disproportionately represented by Native Americans and people of color. Since its opening, the center\u2019s culturally sensitive care approach has reduced the number of custody holds (drug/alcohol emergency law enforcement holds) by over 90 percent. Universal Suicide Screening: Improving Detection of Patients Who Die by Suicide Speakers: Alex Treacher, Senior Data and Applied Scientist at Parkland Center for Clinical Innovation and Jacqueline Naeem, Senior Medical Director at Parkland Center for Clinical Innovation As a vital first step in understanding suicide prevention from a population health perspective and improving risk recognition for treatment application, a large safety-net hospital implemented a universal suicide screening program in 2015, in which all patients ages 10 and older are screened for suicide risk during every provider encounter. This session will determine if the SSP reduces the number of patients falsely identified as not at risk of death by suicide in the cohort by linking mortality data to healthcare utilization data from five years pre- and post-implementation. Leveraging Analytics to Expand the Screening of Depression in Teens Speaker: Charles Golden, Assistant Chief Medical Officer; Vice President, Executive Medical Director Primary Care at Children\u2019s Hospital of Orange County To identify mental health issues early and intervene to prevent severe manifestations, Children\u2019s Hospital of Orange County, a pediatric healthcare system based in California,\u00a0developed comprehensive mental health services and streamlined processes to improve the identification of depression among adolescent patients so it could further enhance the support and treatment offered. After implementing a general protocol of assessment, a standard screening tool and a data platform, CHOC was able to quickly identify patients\u2019 risk levels and methodically intervene to achieve an 81 percent relative increase in depression screening rates for adolescent patients 12-18 years old in a primary care setting and saw a 40 percent relative increase in depression screening rates for adolescent patients 12-18 years old across all clinics.

        "news_content": "HIMSS is celebrating Black History Month by spotlighting HIMSS members who are making a difference for underrepresented minority communities. HIMSS has supported its members in initiatives to remedy racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare like the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021 , the annual Global Health Equity Week , and celebrating black excellence at the HIMSS Global Conference & Exhibition. Today, HIMSS is highlighting Sean Michaels, DNP, MBA-HCA, MSN, RN, CHCIO, CDH-E, CPHIMS. Sean is the AVP, IT Project Management, Business Relationship Management, IT Process Optimization, & Technology Business Management at Orlando Health. Sean has been a HIMSS member since 2011 and is a Certified Professional in Healthcare Information and Management Systems (CPHIMS). What inspired you to pursue a career in health IT, and how has your journey contributed to advancements in the field, particularly for underrepresented communities? Growing up in Miami, my mom was single for a good portion of my childhood. Even when she later remarried, we still struggled financially and did not have access to regular healthcare. Our medical visits were typically reserved for urgent/emergent situations in the ER or walk-in clinics. My healthcare journey began in the military. I had the desire to help people and the military provided a vehicle to gain the education to do so along with access to regular healthcare; both of which were transformative experiences. Over my career, I have worked as a nurse in a variety of settings but was drawn to health IT because it provided opportunities for a positive impact on a larger scale. I was able to help and care for those who were providing direct care. As I became more involved in health IT, my awareness of these and other opportunities increased. I also experienced how technology was initially contributing to a digital barrier for healthcare access. This was impacting those who not only did not have physical access to healthcare but also those who did not have access to technology. Understanding this, and having experienced healthcare disparities growing up, I have been able to bring a unique and diverse perspective to each initiative that I am a part of to help solutions be designed that take into consideration the whole person and what they may or may not have access to. Can you share a specific initiative or project you've been involved in within the industry that has positively impacted addressing health disparities or improving healthcare access for marginalized populations? Two initiatives that I have been a part of that come to mind that have helped address disparities in healthcare are the COVID-19 vaccine process and the use of virtual capabilities or telepresence to provide care. With the vaccine process, I was fortunate to be part of a phenomenal team that designed a technology solution that facilitated mobile documentation and delivery of vaccines. This initiative not only made vaccines accessible at no cost, but it also allowed a group of clinicians to go to a community location where residents were not able to physically travel to the hospital. We not only delivered vaccines efficiently, but also ensured that the process was designed with empathy and inclusivity. The virtual capability of health IT has allowed care to go where the patient is. I had the privilege of participating with another amazing team that established a hospital-at-home program, enabling care to be delivered in patients' homes without the need for hospitalization and without the need for the patient to have existing access to technology. This same technology, combined with telepresence, has also facilitated virtual consultations and is even being used by some organizations to provide virtual clinics in schools. These initiatives underscore the potential of health IT to bring healthcare to where the patient is, breaking down geographical and accessibility barriers.\u00a0 By leveraging technology in healthcare delivery, we not only improve access but also enhance the overall holistic patient experience. We ensure that patients receive care in a comfortable and familiar setting, promoting wellness and reducing stress. It's a testament to the transformative power of health IT, and it inspires me to envision a future where technology continues to revolutionize healthcare accessibility. How do you envision the future of healthcare technology playing a role in promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within the industry? Are there specific areas where you see opportunities for positive change? Technology's role in healthcare is nothing short of visionary. It is revolutionizing healthcare and has the potential to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion on an unprecedented scale. I imagine a future where healthcare technology is not just a tool but an essential and empathetic component of the healthcare journey. In this future, healthcare technology recognizes and celebrates the diversity of the holistic human experience. It doesn't just provide care; it uplifts the individuality of each person it serves. Personalization and precision become the norm, and healthcare is tailored to meet people where they are; and how they are. The healthcare landscape transforms into one where disparities are not just addressed but eliminated. Technology becomes a bridge, connecting communities and individuals with the care and resources they need. It doesn't discriminate based on geographical location, condition, or access to technology; it actively works to bridge these and other gaps. There are numerous areas where I see opportunities for profound and positive change. Firstly, telemedicine and remote monitoring will continue to play a pivotal role in making healthcare accessible to all. However, we must remain steadfast in ensuring that these technologies are designed to accommodate the diverse needs of our communities. Secondly, artificial intelligence and data analytics hold the promise of uncovering and addressing health disparities. These tools have the potential to revolutionize how we identify and mitigate inequalities and needs in healthcare delivery. Cultural competence in technology design will be paramount, ensuring that healthcare solutions respect and adapt to diverse cultural norms and practices. This will be key to providing patient-centered care that resonates with individuals from all walks of life. Furthermore, mentorship and education programs, facilitated through technology, will continue to empower underrepresented individuals to enter the health IT field. Diversifying our industry enriches it with fresh perspectives and ensures that healthcare technology truly reflects the diversity of the communities it serves. Lastly, addressing biases in algorithms and data collection remains an ethical imperative. We must ensure that healthcare technology doesn't perpetuate or worsen existing disparities. This requires ongoing vigilance and commitment to fairness and justice to ensure that technology serves as a force for positive change in healthcare, leaving no one behind.

        "news_content": "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (MNGHA), a publicly funded and Joint Commission International-certified healthcare delivery system, has made great strides along its digital health transformation journey, which began in 2016 when the hospital system sought to meet HIMSS\u2019s EMRAM Stage 6 requirements at King Abdulaziz Medical City \u2013 Riyadh. In 2022, King Abdulaziz Medical City \u2013 Riyadh became the first hospital in the world to achieve Stage 7 in four different models , making it one of the most mature digitally enabled care systems in the world. MNGHA serves some 1.3 million people, including Saudi National Guard service members and their families. A 3,720-bed enterprise, MNGHA offers outpatient services like primary and specialized healthcare, with a current capacity of about 3.2 million patient visits each year. Its healthcare professional workforce is large and diverse, comprising 13,000 multi-specialty physicians, nurses and allied healthcare providers from more than 45 countries. As a HIMSS Organizational Affiliate , MNGHA benefits from HIMSS\u2019s health information and technology education, professional development resources and networking for the entire organization. Throughout 2023 in particular, MNGHA has progressed along its digital health transformation journey within several focus areas. No-Show Prediction at Outpatient Clinic This experience involves employing artificial intelligence techniques to proactively predict which patients are most likely to miss their appointments in outpatient clinics. This works by using machine learning techniques to process, analyze and train data in the electronic medical record (EMR) system that is related to patient, clinic, and appointment history. The result of the classification model will activate an alert for the treating physician in the EMR system, prompting them to take the appropriate action to address the patient at risk of missing an appointment. The solution recommends actions such as sending additional reminders to the patient and booking appointments for patient-in-waiting lists.

        "news_content": "HIMSS and its communities are dedicated to clinical, technical, financial and ethical digital health solutions to decrease maternal mortality and address maternal health issues. Digital health solutions and improvements in maternal health reporting, data collection and expanded telehealth and remote patient monitoring are vital to improving maternal health outcomes. In the United States, which has high maternal mortality rates compared to similarly wealthy countries, HIMSS is influencing public policy at all levels of government to end the maternal mortality and morbidity crisis. Dangerous shortages of labor and delivery services in rural areas across the globe threaten maternal health. Lack of access to maternal care affects up to 6.9 million women and almost 500,000 births across the U.S. annually, according to the March of Dimes. That same report shows a year-over-year increase in maternity care deserts. The issue is expected to worsen, with more than 1,100 U.S. counties already considered maternity care deserts. Valerie Rogers, senior director, government relations, at HIMSS, leads engagement with state, local and tribal health officials on health information and technology policy development. She supports a nationwide network of advocates addressing state/federal legislation/regulations to positively impact all aspects of health information and technology. \u201cStates can take action right now to leverage federal resources and employ strategies toward modernizing health systems and employing telehealth solutions that can help thwart the maternal mortality crisis in this country,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cRecent congressional actions consisting of 13 bills, called the Momnibus, offer many opportunities for nonpartisan maternal health policies and funding solutions for states that advance data collection, transparency, research and analysis. Medicaid waiver programs and state innovation efforts that improve interoperability among maternal and child health systems and care coordination platforms are also essential in filling the gaps in maternal care.\u201d Dr. Natasha Ramontal, digital health strategist, North America, at HIMSS, said digital health is not the sole solution, but digital remote maternal care tools allow for remote monitoring and offer other virtual services like telehealth. \u201cFor example, maternal health consultations and treatments can assist in filling gaps in maternal care and to prevent pregnancy complications,\u201d Ramontal said. \u201cThese services can augment the in-person care lacking in maternal deserts and allow pregnant women to receive the ongoing care they so greatly need.\u201d Dana Castro, senior director of the HIMSS Institute, canvasses geographic adversities that, if digitally reformed, can transform lives for under-represented and marginalized populations. \u201cThis is not a time to settle for the status quo,\u201d Castro said. \u201cObstetrics care is fragmented \u2014 involving multiple stakeholders and resources over the pregnancy and postnatal periods \u2014 and ensuring patient data is transferred quickly, accurately and securely is challenging when systems lack interoperability and care deserts are widening. In this patchwork physical and information environment, there may be grave consequences for patient privacy, safety and quality, especially for Black pregnant mothers.\u201d The 2024 HIMSS Global Health Conference & Exhibition, taking place March 11-15 in Orlando, features education sessions on top-of-mind issues, including health equity issues such as access to care, barriers to care delivery, digital literacy, health disparities and inequities and social determinants of health.

        "news_content": "By Lee Kim, senior principal, cybersecurity and privacy, HIMSS Healthcare cybersecurity professionals should look to the start of 2024 as an opportunity to look at their cybersecurity programs with a fresh perspective. Think about how well the program is performing, as well as how well it is being governed. Engage both senior management and executives to be champions of the enterprise-wide cybersecurity program. Contemplate how security awareness initiatives and briefings can be re-invigorated for the new year. Last, but not least, gauge how well your organization is doing in keeping up with technological advancements such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, 5G, cloud computing, and the Internet of (Many) Things. Take the time to think of how your cybersecurity strategy can be refreshed in light of changing times. We are now in a new era. More to come this year as we look to revealing the results of the 2024 HIMSS Healthcare Cybersecurity Survey during the first quarter of this year. 2023 Edition of the Health Industry Cybersecurity Practices In April 2023, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released the 2023 edition of the Health Industry Cybersecurity Practices: Managing Threats and Protecting Patients (HICP). This set of guidelines and best practices for healthcare providers aims to improve both security and resilience. The HICP is an example of recognized security practices for the healthcare industry. While the recognized security practices are voluntary, evidence that a regulated entity is adhering to recognized security practices may be considered as a mitigating factor in regard to audits and investigations by the Office for Civil Rights in accordance with the recent 2021 amendment to the HITECH Act. Regulated entities should demonstrate that they are actively and consistently using these recognized security practices and that they have been fully implemented . Online Tracking Technologies The Office for Civil Rights and the Federal Trade Commission warned hospital systems and telehealth providers about the various privacy and security risks from online tracking technologies in July 2023. Covered entities need to understand exactly how protected health information is being used within its environment. This includes any processing that may be done on behalf of the business associate that is performing a function on behalf of the covered entity. But even if an entity is not regulated by the Office of Civil Rights, it may be subject to oversight from the FTC. FTC Act Enforcement Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\u201d In February and May of 2023, the FTC announced enforcement actions against vendors for the impermissible use and sharing of personal health information. Companies that do not disclose that personal health information is sold and/or shared with third parties, despite promises to the contrary, may be in violation of the FTC Act. Additionally, failing to adequately protect personal health information may also be in violation of the FTC Act. Furthermore, even if entities are not subject to HIPAA and the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, they may be subject to the FTC and its FTC Health Breach Notification Rule. NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 In August 2023, NIST released a draft version of the Cybersecurity Framework 2.0. A significant new addition to the framework is the Govern core function. The core functions are now Govern, Identify, Protect, Respond, and Recover. Above all, robust governance is paramount for a well-functioning and effective cybersecurity program. Further, cybersecurity supply chain risk management is integrated throughout CSF 2.0. The final version of NIST CSF 2.0 is expected in early 2024. Additional resources can be found on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework resource page. SEC Cybersecurity Disclosure Rules Also in August 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission published its final cybersecurity disclosure rules amending certain requirements of U.S. publicly traded companies . These companies are now required to publicly report material cybersecurity incidents without unreasonable delay and no later than four calendar days after the determination of materiality has been made (Form 8-K). Information on the management and oversight of the cybersecurity program is also required in annual filings (Form 10-K). HHS Cybersecurity Performance Goals Finally, in December 2023, the US Department of Health and Human Services released a concept paper that announced the forthcoming healthcare sector-specific cybersecurity performance goals. The sector-specific cybersecurity performance goals are voluntary, but healthcare entities will be empowered to better plan and prioritize the implementation of robust cybersecurity practices. Cybersecurity at HIMSS24 Gain insights at the 2024 HIMSS Global Health Conference & Exhibition into how cybersecurity experts are safeguarding healthcare, expanding the digital landscape and ensuring the security of data. Discuss evolving strategies, investments and innovations. Rachel Tobac, CEO of SocialProof Security, will deliver a keynote diving into the anatomy of trust exploitation in real world social engineering attacks, walking through step-by-step examples of attacks that happened during COVID-19, and identifying the steps to protect data, money, security and privacy from real world attackers.
