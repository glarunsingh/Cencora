Earlier Monday, party leaders outlined a virtual balloting process to officially designate a nominee by Aug. 7.

Holder is expected to run point on the vetting process for Harris, a source briefed on the matter said.Read More\nIn the meantime, Harris will launchher nascent presidential campaign in earnest today with a rally in Milwaukee seeking to answer the biggest question on skittish Democrats\u2019 minds: How does she plan to beat Donald Trump?\nIt\u2019s a sizable challenge for Harris,who must re-introduce herself to the country. That task will require reassembling the coalition of moderate and progressive voters that Biden rode to the White House four years ago, and overcoming dissatisfaction over the administration\u2019s handling of the economy.Read More\nAlso Read:\nIf Harris wins the election,she would be in a better position than President Joe Biden \u2014 who is now a lame duck president \u2014 to immediately shape the final stretch of the 118th Congress. Lawmakers are considering lingering legislation on such key issues as farm policy, defense and appropriations.\nBiden\u2019s endorsementof Harris makes lame-duck negotiations on government funding, and possibly the debt limit, more unpredictable. Republicans had already been debating whether to seek a spending deal in December or wait until 2025, when they may have more leverage.\nCongress also technically faces a Jan. 1 deadlineto lift or suspend the debt limit, but Treasury officials can buy more time with so-called \u201cextraordinary measures.\u201d Lawmakers weren\u2019t certain if they would seek negotiations in the lame duck. If they don\u2019t resolve the issue quickly, they\u2019re guaranteed to face a deadline early in a new presidential administration.Read More\nBiden\u2019s exit from the 2024 raceimmediately sparked speculation about whether Republicans could convince courts to keep the eventual Democratic nominee\u2019s name from appearing on ballots or block access to Biden\u2019s campaign dollars.

But when it comes to defending their First Amendment rights, they paint themselves as content developers\u2014in contradiction to their Section 230 arguments.

But the contours of the race have made winning over new converts seem less urgent.\nThe triumphant set piece for Trump made for a stark contrastwith his rival, President Joe Biden, whose campaign is at its lowest moment as the candidate isolates at home due to Covid-19 while a rebellion simmers in his party that could force him off the ticket. Before Trump\u2019s speech, Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.)joined calls for Biden to bow out, the second senator to do so.\nDemocrats, however, saw an openingin Trump\u2019s speech, with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee saying it laid bare an \u201cextreme agenda\u201d and Biden\u2019s campaign hitting him for sidestepping subjects like his pledge to pardon those convicted of participating in the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the US Capitol.Read More\nTrump also used his nomination speechto take aim at Biden\u2019s electric vehicle policies, vowing to end them on his first day in office.Read More\nAdditionally, he reiterated an opennessfor Chinese automakers to build cars in the US as a way to boost the economy.Read More\nMore on Trump\u2019s Speech:\nProject 2025:Conservatives behind an extensive plan for reshaping the US government known as Project 2025 see it as a resource for the next presidency of Trump, should he succeed in his bid to return to the White House.
