       "  'news': 'No investment in the equity markets (or anywhere else, for that matter) is entirely risk-free. However, some stocks look safe enough to allow investors to rest easy at night, knowing the shares are highly unlikely to experience significant losses. Though corporations in this category tend to have less upside potential, they have a place in the portfolios of investors with a long-term mindset.\\n\\nHere are two strong candidates along those lines: Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and HCA Healthcare (NYSE: HCA). Read on to find out why these healthcare stocks are worth holding onto for a long time.\\n\\nA company doesn\\'t last for more than a hundred years by accident. Johnson & Johnson has been around that long and has survived recessions, depressions, administrations from across the political spectrum, and more. That\\'s made possible largely thanks to a culture of innovation that transcends any particular CEO or management team the company has had. Johnson & Johnson routinely develops important, lifesaving medicines and medical devices.\\n\\nThe company\\'s portfolios in these areas are among the deepest and most impressive in these industries. Revenue and earnings growth, though not extraordinary, is generally steady and reliable, especially once you zoom out.\\n\\nIt\\'s true that Johnson & Johnson is currently facing significant headwinds, including a barrage of lawsuits and a relatively new law that will allow Medicare in the U.S. to negotiate the prices of some drugs. That will almost certainly reduce the average selling prices of some of J&J\\'s medicines, and, by extension, the company\\'s revenue from them.\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson\\'s long and successful history should give investors confidence that it can navigate these troubles. The past isn\\'t a guarantee of anything, but there is no denying the company\\'s strong underlying business and its ability to continue delivering solid results across very different periods and under varied legal and regulatory circumstances. Johnson & Johnson is one of the rare companies with a credit rating that is higher than that of the U.S. government itself.\\n\\nHere\\'s another piece of evidence of Johnson & Johnson\\'s reliability: The company has raised its dividend payout for 62 consecutive years. That requires stability and the ability to consistently grow earnings and cash flows -- precisely what J&J has done for a long time. Opting to reinvest those dividends will boost long-term returns, too. So while it is worth keeping an eye on Johnson & Johnson\\'s current headwinds, it remains one of the safer options I know of in the stock market.\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson is an excellent pick for income-seeking investors with a \"buy and hold forever\" mindset.\\n\\nHCA Healthcare has also been around for a while. The company\\'s history dates back to the late 1960s. It is one of the leading hospital chains in the U.S., with a vast network of facilities across the country, particularly concentrated in Texas and Florida. Breaking into this business and challenging established leaders is difficult for at least two reasons. First, building medical facilities is capital intensive -- it requires a significant up-front investment.\\n\\nSecond, hospital chains that have been around a while, like HCA Healthcare, have built relationships with patients, communities, doctors, and third-party payers. Consumers tend to gravitate toward products and brands they know and trust. That is especially true in the healthcare field, where people\\'s lives are at stake. These factors grant HCA Healthcare a significant advantage that should allow it to remain a leader for a while.\\n\\nAnd even among already established major players in the market, the company has grown its share. It was just 23% in 2011; by the end of 2019, it was about 26.5%, and in 2022, it had reached about 28%. That\\'s meaningful and impressive growth in a competitive industry like the one in which HCA Healthcare operates.\\n\\nIt accomplished this feat even during the difficult pandemic years, when occupancy levels (a key determinant for total revenue in the industry) in its facilities and those of its competitors fluctuated due to the public health crisis. In other words, HCA Healthcare handled the outbreak at least as well as its peers. Financial results have been strong over the past decade, too.\\n\\nHCA Healthcare should benefit from increasing lifespans, along with the growing elderly population, over the coming decades. By positioning itself well to provide medical care for seniors, HCA Healthcare should deliver outsize returns for a while.\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in Johnson & Johnson, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Johnson & Johnson wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\\n\\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $746,217!\\n\\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

FHP says the dump truck then dragged the man's sedan to final rest, coming to a controlled stop on the east paved shoulder. Furthermore, St. Johns County Fire Rescue said on Facebook that the crash caused flames. The fire department also said the man had to be airlifted to be taken to the hospital.

       "  'news': 'Today St James’s Hospital marked the 40th anniversary of the first bone marrow transplant which took place in Ireland in 1984. This procedure marked the beginning of a pioneering treatment at the hospital, which now performs stem cell transplants in almost 200 patients from across the island of Ireland each year. Professor Shaun McCann, emeritus Professor of Haematology at Trinity College Dublin and Head of Transplantation at St James’s Hospital performed the first transplant with an expert team in 1984. Since then, the National Adult Stem Cell Transplantation Service has expanded to include the first Irish centre for Adult CAR T-Cell Therapy. Such cellular therapy treatments are often life-saving treatments for blood related cancers such as leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma but also include some rare cases of bone marrow failure. The service is currently the third largest of its kind in the UK and Ireland, with patients referred from all over the country (including some patients from Northern Ireland) to St James’s Hospital. Speaking today at an event at the hospital to celebrate the milestone, Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly TD said: “I am delighted to join St James’s Hospital and Trinity St James’s Cancer Institute today to acknowledge and celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first bone marrow transplant in Ireland. Over the past 40 years, transplant expertise at St James’s Hospital has gone from strength to strength and the team has shown their dedication to the development of transplant services for those patients diagnosed with blood-related cancers in Ireland. I congratulate the hospital on this achievement and wish them continued success over the next 40 years.” With a growing and ageing population, the number of blood cancer cases in Ireland and globally continues to rise. Stem cell transplants (sometimes referred to as bone marrow transplants) are used to treat and cure many types of blood-related cancers such as leukaemia, lymphoma or multiple myeloma as well as rare bone marrow failure conditions and solid-organ tumours. The purpose of the transplant is to cure the blood cancer or keep the haematological disease in remission for as long as possible. In allogeneic stem cell transplantation, healthy stem cells are transplanted from one individual to another. Alternatively, in an autologous transplant the patient’s own stem cells are used. The first bone marrow transplant at St James’s Hospital was an allogeneic transplant where donor stem cells were harvested from a sibling in order to treat a patient with leukaemia. Mairsile Hourihane (pictured below, centre, with Kevin Rooney and fellow transplant recipient Mark Fagan) received a bone marrow transplant at St James’s Hospital in 1989 and was at today’s celebration. She said: “My diagnosis of CML nearly 40 years ago was the beginning of an uncertain and scary time in my life. After my diagnosis in St Vincent’s Hospital, I was under the care of excellent haematologists with a support team at St James’s Hospital, who ultimately saved my life. Even though the service was in its infancy when I received my bone marrow transplant, I always knew that I was lucky to be in the best place with the best team looking after me, and I am delighted to be here to celebrate all that the team continues to achieve.” The work of the Stem Cell Transplantation Service is supported by many departments and organisations within St James’s Hospital/Trinity St James’s Cancer Institute and beyond. In particular, links with clinical teams within the hospital including the intensive care unit, close liaison with the Irish Unrelated Donor Registry and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service are crucial to find compatible donors for those who do not have a suitably matched family donor and to ensure that complications for patients are kept at a minimum. Since its inception, the transplant unit has been supported by the Bone Marrow for Leukaemia Trust, a charitable organisation, which has provided equipment, contributed to funding for staff and the development of accommodation for patients post their stem cell transplant. Dr Catherine Flynn, Consultant Haematologist and Associate Clinical Professor at the Trinity St James’s Cancer Institute, said: “This anniversary is a huge achievement for all St James’s staff, past and present. Since 1984, we have provided stem cell and bone marrow transplants to over 3,750 patients, improving rates of survival for patients with blood cancer and giving them fresh hope. Looking after our increasing number of transplant survivors is a privilege but also presents a growing challenge. Our service would not be able to run without our dedicated nursing staff and colleagues throughout the hospital. We work very closely with bodies such as the Irish Blood Transfusion Service and are very grateful to the many stem cell donors from all over the world. We are hopeful that we can continue to grow our service through adequate support and resources.” Acknowledging this milestone in cancer care in Ireland, Professor Mary Day, St James’s Hospital Chief Executive Officer said: “St James’s Hospital has a long history of stem cell and bone marrow transplant and this anniversary would not have been reached without the clinical expertise that we have accumulated and developed. The ground-breaking work of our expert clinicians, such as Professor McCann, has allowed us to cement our place as a world leader in cancer care and led us to the establishment of the Trinity St James’s Cancer Institute, the first OECI-accredited cancer institute in Ireland.”'},\n",

       "  'news': 'Researchers using high-tech air monitoring equipment rolled through an industrialized stretch of southeast Louisiana in mobile labs and found levels of a carcinogen in concentrations as much as 10 times higher than previously estimated, according to a paper published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. The study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University raises new health concerns for communities that sit among the chemical plants lining a stretch of the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans — dubbed “cancer alley” by environmentalists. The Environmental Protection Agency considers long-term exposure to inhaled ethylene oxide gas a cancer risk — a stance challenged by the chemical industry. The state of California, which has its own environmental health agency, also lists the chemical as “known to cause cancer and reproductive toxicity” in men and women. The study also heralds newer technologies that enable better, more accurate measurements of ethylene oxide and other chemicals. “The instrumentation technology that we have available to us is just much more sensitive and can be put on vans and driven around in ways that you don’t get with regulatory instruments,” said Pete DeCarlo, one of the researchers on the study. Ethylene oxide is produced in large amounts and used to make a main ingredient in antifreeze and polyester. It’s also used to sterilize food, cosmetics and medical equipment and as a pesticide. The report comes as the Biden administration has taken steps to lessen people’s exposure to the gas. Earlier this year, EPA announced plans to limit the use of the chemical. And ethylene oxide also figures in a broad order issued in April requiring more than 200 plants nationwide to reduce toxic emissions. Traditionally, measurements of ethylene oxide have been made by gathering and storing air samples in stainless steel cannisters for later lab analyses. The problem, DeCarlo said, is that storage in the cannisters appears to alter the concentration of the gas. Current regulatory figures on ethylene oxide levels are based on samples self-reported by the industry. Those numbers, he said, are “anywhere from two to 10 times lower than the values that we measured with our mobile laboratory in Louisiana.” The Johns Hopkins study involved two vans that drove the same routes repeatedly over the course of a month last year. Researchers used instruments that measure gases in real time as they flow through a high-intensity light. The vans used two different instruments, yet they measured similar results, bolstering researchers’ confidence in the testing. DeCarlo said nearly all the readings were higher than 11 parts of ethylene oxide per 1 trillion parts of air — a level that translates to a one in 10,000 cancer risk for long-term exposure to the gas. That’s the upper threshold of what the EPA considers acceptable for many air toxics and carcinogens. Sometimes levels were a thousand times higher — measured in parts per billion rather than per trillion. And, notes Keeve Nachman, another of the Johns Hopkins researchers, ethylene oxide is only one of the pollutants emitted in the area. “When you think about all the other chemicals that are in play and all of the other concerns that we may have about people who live in Cancer Alley and the other life stressors they have to deal with, they may be less resilient to an exposure to ethylene oxide than someone in the general population,” Nachman said. “So, you know, if if you were to say, what’s the appropriate level or what should the acceptable risk be? It should probably be lower than 1 in 10,000 people out there.” Short-term exposure to the levels poses little risk to the vast majority of people, said Reed Rustin, a professor at Tulane University’s School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. “My concern would be for at-risk individuals who are exposed over a lifetime, which is difficult to estimate, but should be a concern to investigate further,” Rustin said. The American Chemical Council has questioned what it called “a deeply flawed” method to determine the toxicity of ethylene oxide. Tuesday’s report is likely to feed into ongoing political and legal battles over the array of chemical plants among small, often predominantly Black communities between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Amid such debates, improving measurements of pollutants is important, DeCarlo said, noting there is little high quality measurement around industrial plants, so it’s not well understood what residents are actually exposed to. “We wanted to start to do a better job of assessing what those hazardous air pollutant concentrations look like for communities who live in and around industrial facilities,” he said.'},\n",

       "('The University of Houston Andy and Barbara Gessner College of Nursing has earned prestigious national\\u202faccreditation from the Society of Simulation in Healthcare. The College is the first and only college in the greater-Houston area to achieve this accreditation. The Methodist Sugar Land Hospital Nursing Simulation Center at UH at Sugar Land and the HCA Houston Healthcare Nursing Simulation Center at UH at Katy feature state-of-the-art mannequins and tools for multi-disciplinary, hospital-based training in a realistic environment. Through this dynamic learning, students practice, observe and are evaluated in various environments such as maternity, hospice, emergency room and bedside care. Beena Joseph, clinical assistant professor/clinical learning coordinator at the Gessner College of Nursing, led the effort to gain accreditation at the two sites. In a recent perioperative nursing course at Gessner College, it was easy to see how the college earned its accreditation. The course focused on simulations, and students, using virtual reality, put themselves into a virtual operating room. Once inside, the students perform the tasks of an operating room nurse, maintaining sterility, assisting surgeons, handing them instruments and anticipating surgical needs. The simulations use a gaming feature where the students earn points to help them become familiar and better with the requirements of the surgical nurse. The students also see the inside of the human body where the surgery is taking place. Perioperative nurses, sometimes called surgical or operating room nurses, oversee the care of patients before, during and after surgery. The course, in its 10th year as a “mini-mester,” is a two-week elective that mixes a week of classroom/sim lab learning and a week of learning in an operating room. “The SSH accreditation underscores the importance of simulation labs in healthcare education,” said Kathryn Tart, professor and founding dean of the Gessner College of Nursing. “As we focus on clinical excellence, sim labs provide safe environments for our students to hone their skills. We are grateful for our health care partners who have invested in our college and in the future of nursing. Their support has positioned us to achieve this\\u202faccreditation.” Assistant professor of nursing at Gessner College, Danielle Quintana, herself a certified perioperative nurse, helped Dean Tart create the class. Not many nursing colleges have a focus on or program for perioperative nursing care. Quintana’s latest research suggests that because of severe perioperative nursing shortages coupled with a lack of clinical sites (hospitals/health care facilities that open their doors to nursing students to learn), these kinds of classes present a win-win situation: training needed specialty nurses and securing new clinical sites for nursing students. “An opportunity exists for faculty, regardless of having perioperative nursing experience or not, to use perioperative environments for clinical experiences in didactic and simulation courses,” said Quintana. “The simulation lab is an ideal place to provide students with learning opportunities to apply what they know by safely demonstrating skill acquisition.” To secure SSH\\u202faccreditation, health care entities are evaluated on mission and governance, program management, resource management, human resources, program improvement, ethics and expanding the field. Additionally, programs are evaluated on their assessment, research and teaching/education standards. Completing the evaluation process, which includes a scheduled visit by reviewers, spans the better part of a year.\\u202fAccreditation is granted for a five-year period.',\n",
       " \"The University of Houston Andy and Barbara Gessner College of Nursing has received national accreditation from the Society of Simulation in Healthcare, making it the first in the greater-Houston area to do so. The accreditation recognizes the college's advanced simulation centers and dynamic learning environments. The perioperative nursing course, which uses virtual reality for training, exemplifies the college's innovative approach. The accreditation process evaluates various aspects of healthcare education and is valid for five years.\")"
