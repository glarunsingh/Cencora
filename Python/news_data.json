User-centric design should be developed with a wide-range of health literacy and other capabilities of all patient populations.Scalable frameworks that consider the challenges faced by healthcare delivery sites focused on caring for underserved communities should be considered when health IT standards and systems are under development. HIMSS recommended that ONC include equity by design mechanisms through its federal coordination efforts, technical guidance and certification criteria specifications for equity metrics.To build trust in underserved communities, HIMSS called on ONC to improve and be more intentional when engaging in community collaboration with underserved communities, especially Tribal populations, when considering the design and implementation of health IT systems in a manner to promote health equity.HIMSS is invested in working with stakeholders across the sector to co-design actionable frameworks for industry and providers to incorporate health equity by design.To learn more about HIMSS efforts to promote health equity, please contact HIMSS Public Policy team atpolicy@himss.org.HIMSS Public Policy and AdvocacyThe HIMSS policy team works closely with the U.S. Congress, federal decision makers, state legislatures and governments, and other organizations to recommend policy, and legislative and regulatory solutions to improve health through information and technology.Help Advance Health IT Policy"

        "content": "HIMSS has reiterated its call for significant investment in public health information data modernization and interoperability capability.HIMSS submitted its call to action throughpublic commentsresponding to a request for information (RFI) from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services about methods to improve electronic reporting of public health data to state and local public health agencies.The RFI, which was part of CMS\u2019sannual Inpatient Prospective Payment System proposed rule, asked stakeholders about potential methods, including changing the attestation measure for capability to report public health data electronically to a numerator/denominator quality measure.HIMSS indicated measuring success in reporting public health data is a goal, but the current lack of capability in many public health agencies to receive the data electronically would require a wide range of exemptions, limiting the value of a measure while placing additional burden on health systems.HIMSS continues to endorse significant IT infrastructure funding, with corresponding technical support and workforce development by HHS, as recommended inHIMSS 2022 Public Health Information and Technology Infrastructure Funding Report.In the response, HIMSS also supported proposed changes by CMS for electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM) reporting for both the Promoting Interoperability Program and the Inpatient Quality Reporting Program.The proposed changes included the addition of patient safety focused measures (measuring patient falls and post-surgical respiratory failure) to the self-selected menu for quality reporting starting in 2026, and increasing the number of eCQMs required for reporting, going from six to nine in 2026 and nine to eleven in 2027.HIMSS\u2019s assessment of the new measures determined that the timeline to successfully implement the mechanisms for capturing and reporting the needed data to meet the measures was appropriate, and each of the new measures are meaningful and actionable, meaning improving measure performance should positively impact patient outcomes.HIMSS Public Policy and AdvocacyThe HIMSS policy team works closely with the U.S. Congress, federal decision makers, state legislatures and governments, and other organizations to recommend policy, and legislative and regulatory solutions to improve health through information and technology.Help Advance Health IT Policy"

Arizona Chapter Advocate Marjorie Rosenorganized the tripas part of the HIMSS Chapter Advocacy Program, which leverages HIMSS\u2019s reach and resources to influence public policy to advance healthcare and population health for all.Marci Little, a health administration student at Bryan University, class of 2025, wrote the following summary of her experience.The healthcare students from Bryan University were given the opportunity to be in Washington, D.C., for a week from April 12-18. We were invited to participate in the school\u2019s Paralegal Program trip. We got the chance to see memorials, monuments, The Supreme Court, Capitol Hill and so many other sites.For me, I was so glad to be able to see the monuments and memorials, but what I wasn\u2019t prepared for was the amazing experience of advocating through HIMSS. This was the best most memorable part of the week for me!For three nights of the trip, we were given the basics of what advocacy is, how it works and what to expect by Marjorie Rosen, Program Director of Healthcare. Everyone had the opportunity to ask questions regarding advocacy and how it works. I knew about advocacy as I had to do a PPE in advocacy to get my associate\u2019s degree. I started to see myself advocating after that assignment.My love of advocacy was fueled during this trip! We attended a meeting with HIMSS in D.C. They showed us everything they possibly could about advocacy. It was beyond amazing! I fell in love with advocacy. We met some amazing people and even got to take a few photos with them. Questions were asked and answered while each of us took notes, mentally or written. We had the chance to see Marjorie teach alongside the HIMSS group regarding what the MATCH IT Act is and how we could help.For our advocacy day on Capitol Hill, we were split into groups. Our job was to meet with our representatives and get them on board with the MATCH IT Act. I had the pleasure of being the speaker of our group at each of our meetings. I am not a great speaker, but I found my voice in advocating. If I took anything from this trip, it is that advocacy is needed to change things, whether it\u2019s in healthcare, government or in your own life.I am so grateful for the opportunity we had to be a part of this during that week. If given the opportunity again, I would gladly take it!HIMSS Public Policy and AdvocacyThe HIMSS policy team works closely with the U.S. Congress, federal decision makers, state legislatures and governments, and other organizations to recommend policy, and legislative and regulatory solutions to improve health through information and technology.Help Advance Health IT Policy"

This increase in funding would help advance interoperability and nationwide, standards-based health information exchange to support better health enabled by data.Read the full letter to congressional appropriations.HIMSS, along with AHIMA and CHIME, led the joint effort that garnered over 50 signers. The letter explained that this necessary funding boost would provide the agency with the resources they have long needed to better serve as the key partner to both public and private sector stakeholders to advance the health information and technology ecosystem. Without this much-needed increase, the organizations worry that they will be hard-pressed to successfully execute the many agency initiatives, and priorities of Congress and the Administration.ONC supports a wide array of initiatives aimed at advancing national goals for better, safer, and more equitable healthcare through a nationwide interoperable health IT infrastructure. These include ensuring technology solutions incorporate baseline cybersecurity and privacy requirements, a health equity by design philosophy for federal health IT programs, continued advancements in patient access to health information and meaningful engagement in their care, and working to advance U.S. public health data infrastructure modernization.To further engage in on this issue, please contactpolicy@himss.org.HIMSS Public Policy and AdvocacyThe HIMSS policy team works closely with the U.S. Congress, federal decision makers, state legislatures and governments, and other organizations to recommend policy, and legislative and regulatory solutions to improve health through information and technology.Help Advance Health IT Policy"

        "title": "Office for Civil Rights Announces Final Rule to Protect Reproductive Healthcare Data Privacy",
        "content": "On April 22, 2024, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) finalized its rule,HIPAA Privacy Rule to Support Reproductive Health Care Privacy.The rule aims to improve patient data protections around lawful reproductive health care services, thereby encouraging patients to seek these services when necessary and improve patient trust in the healthcare system.HIMSS strongly supports the overall goals of this rule, which specifically \u201cprohibits uses and disclosures of protected health information (PHI) for criminal, civil, or administrative investigations or proceedings against individuals\u201d for seeking, obtaining, providing or facilitating reproductive healthcare that is lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided.HIMSS applauds OCR\u2019s decisions to properly educate covered entities about this rule, to provide a model attestation in advance of the rule\u2019s compliance date of December 23, 2024, and to educate patients through, for example, requiring the patient\u2019s Notice of Privacy Protections form to be made available in multiple languages. HIMSS continues to encourage OCR to explore health IT solutions for delivering the Notice of Privacy Protections and other privacy education resources to patients in culturally inclusive ways.HIMSS anticipates that several provisions of the final rule may present challenges for ubiquitous information exchange in a manner that also provides the appropriate protections for patients. In apublic commentletter responding to the proposed rule from June 16, 2023, HIMSS called on OCR to expand these protections to patients receiving all forms of healthcare. HIMSS believes that healthcare information should not be used unfairly against patients and determining who has access and reasons for access should be the same for all healthcare interventions, not only for reproductive health care services. OCR did not adopt HIMSS\u2019s recommendation, however HIMSS will continue to advocate for these protections for patients in future public comment opportunities.HIMSS also raised concerns about the challenges to parse out reproductive health data and protect those data in a different manner than other healthcare data, as required in the Final Rule. Healthcare organizations report significant operational challenges segregating certain types of personal health information (PHI) from other PHI. OCR acknowledges this challenge, however, asserts that this is critical to improve patient protections for reproductive health, as this specific type of data may unfairly target patients in the current US political landscape. OCR broadly defined reproductive health services, with a non-exhaustive list of examples of services, which aims to make this process easier. OCR also asserts that this rule should not increase data segmentation concerns beyond those that already exist. HIMSS recommends continued work at ONC to improve data sharing and segmentation standards to reduce unnecessary administrative burden and costs on health systems.Overall, HIMSS is highly pleased with OCR\u2019s final rule and recognizes the importance of protecting reproductive health data, which would improve patient trust and willingness to receive lawful reproductive health care services. HIMSS regularly analyzes and seeks comments on federal regulations.
